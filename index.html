This new book by one of our finest critics explains&#x2014;historically, in depth, and with interviews with the celebrated creators themselves&#x2014;how the art of must-see/binge-watch television evolved. </b><br><br>Darwin had his theory of evolution, and David Bianculli has his. Bianculli's theory has to do with the concept of quality television: what it is and, crucially, how it got that way. In tracing the evolutionary history of our progress toward a Platinum Age of Television&#x2014;our age, the era of <i>The Sopranos</i> and <i>Breaking Bad</i> and <i>Mad Men</i> and <i>The Wire</i> and <i>Homeland</i> and <i>Girls</i>&#x2014;he focuses on the development of the classic TV genres, among them the sitcom, the crime show, the miniseries, the soap opera, the western, the animated series and the late night talk show. In each genre, he selects five key examples of the form, tracing its continuities and its dramatic departures and drawing on exclusive and in-depth interviews with many of the most famed auteurs in television history.<br><br>Television has triumphantly come of age artistically; David Bianculli's book is the first to date to examine, in depth and in detail and with a keen critical and historical sense, how this inspiring development came about.</p><p>DAVID BIANCULLI is a guest host and TV critic on NPR's <i>Fresh Air </i>with Terry Gross. A contributor to the show since its inception, he has been a TV critic since 1975. From 1993 to 2007, Bianculli was a TV critic for the <i>New York Daily News</i>. Bianculli has written three books: <i>Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour </i>(Simon &amp; Schuster/Touchstone, 2009); <i>Teleliteracy: Taking Television Seriously </i>(1992); and <i>Dictionary of Teleliteracy</i> (1996). An associate professor of TV and film at Rowan University in New Jersey, Bianculli is also the founder and editor of the online magazine, TVWorthWatching.com.1 CHILDREN&#x2019;S PROGRAMS<br><br>KEY EVOLUTIONARY STAGES<br><br>The Mickey Mouse Club1955&#x2013;59, ABC<br><br>Captain Kangaroo1955&#x2013;84, CBS<br><br>Mister Rogers&#x2019; Neighborhood1968&#x2013;2001, NET/PBS<br><br>Sesame Street1969&#x2013;, PBS; 2016&#x2013;, HBO<br><br>Pee-Wee&#x2019;s Playhouse1986&#x2013;91, CBS<br><br>No matter where you grew up, and for the most part no matter when, your TV was most likely populated by local shows made especially for children. The earliest ones were hosted by earnest, often costumed adults, presenting old theatrical cartoons and/or interacting with puppets or marionettes. Some of these early homegrown pioneers &#x201c;matured&#x201d; into national shows presented by one of the major broadcast networks, such as NBC&#x2019;s Kukla, Fran, and Ollie, which had begun on local TV in Chicago in 1947. But others, from 1948&#x2019;s Junior Frolics (a cartoon showcase from Newark, New Jersey, hosted by &#x201c;Uncle Fred&#x201d; Sayles) to 1950&#x2019;s Popeye Theater (a weekday afternoon Philadelphia children&#x2019;s show hosted for more than twenty years by the &#x201c;cowgirl&#x201d; Sally Starr), remained proudly local for their entire runs. Wherever you lived, if television was a part of your early life, so was children&#x2019;s TV. I was born in Pittsburgh in 1953, and one of my first TV memories is of watching a local public television show called The Children&#x2019;s Corner, hosted by Josie Carey starting in 1954, and featuring her interacting with such puppets as Daniel Striped Tiger and King Friday XIII&#x2014;puppets created and voiced by the show&#x2019;s producer and music composer, Fred Rogers, years before he would launch his own successful children&#x2019;s series, Mister Rogers&#x2019; Neighborhood.<br><br>Technically, the earliest TV children&#x2019;s show host might have been Burr Tillstrom, the puppeteer creator and voice of the clown-like Kukla, the friendly dragon Ollie, and other whimsical hand-puppet characters. He and his puppets appeared on TV before there was broadcast TV, as featured players during RCA&#x2019;s television exhibition at the 1939&#x2013;40 New York World&#x2019;s Fair. After World War II, when television production began in earnest, Tillstrom teamed with the Chicago radio personality Fran Allison in 1947 on a local children&#x2019;s show, giving her equal billing with two of his puppet creations. Within a year, Kukla, Fran, and Ollie was a popular national offering on the NBC network, where it lasted for an entire decade.<br><br>That show&#x2019;s NBC lead-in, running at five o&#x2019;clock weekdays on the East Coast, was even more popular and ranks as TV&#x2019;s first runaway children&#x2019;s TV hit. It began as Puppet Playhouse in 1947, back when NBC&#x2019;s &#x201c;network&#x201d; of stations was limited to a few cities along the northeast corridor, and premiered at a time when the concept of using television as a babysitter, previously unheard of, was instantly embraced. In a rave review of the debut of Puppet Playhouse that today would incense child advocates and women alike, Variety wrote, &#x201c;In the middle-class home, there is perhaps nothing as welcome to the mother as something that will keep the small fry intently absorbed and out of possible mischief. This program can almost be guaranteed to pin down the squirmiest of the brood.&#x201d; Puppet Playhouse was created and hosted by &#x201c;Buffalo&#x201d; Bob Smith, but the show was quickly renamed Howdy Doody, after his marionette co-star. Like many children&#x2019;s shows that followed it, Howdy Doody featured a studio audience of overstimulated, sugar-engorged kids (called, in this case, the Peanut Gallery). It also featured a silent, horn-honking clown named Clarabell (played, over the course of the series, by three different actors, including the future Captain Kangaroo host, Bob Keeshan); the beautiful princess Summerfall Winterspring (played by Judy Tyler, who would go on to star in Jailhouse Rock opposite Elvis Presley); and a spineless character named Gumby, who was soon spun off into his own series. Give Howdy Doody credit, too, for the most unsettling finale in TV history: On the final show, Smith kept promising that Clarabell, then played by Lew Anderson, would have a special surprise. After thirteen years of silence, Clarabell ended the show, and the series, by staring into the camera and, in a choked whisper, saying, &#x201c;Good-bye, kids.&#x201d;<br><br>Other early TV children&#x2019;s hits included ABC&#x2019;s Super Circus (like Kukla, Fran, and Ollie, going national in 1949 after starting in Chicago), hosted by Claude Kirchner and, later, Jerry Colonna and featuring the baton-catching, and eye-catching, baton twirler Mary Hartline. A singular children&#x2019;s star from the 1950s was Milton Hines, a.k.a. Soupy Sales, who had a unique career path by not only succeeding on network TV and in syndication but moving from one local market to another and conquering them individually. He started in Cincinnati, on a local 1950 show called Soupy&#x2019;s Soda Shop, then moved in 1953 to Detroit, where he simultaneously hosted a daytime kids&#x2019; show (Lunch with Soupy Sales) and a slightly more mature late-night effort (Soupy&#x2019;s On, the surviving kinescopes of which include rare performance footage of the great jazz trumpeter Clifford Brown from 1956). The daytime show, with its pie-in-the-face comedy style (and I mean that literally), was so popular with kids ABC picked it up, renaming it The Soupy Sales Show. And when the host moved his base of operations again, this time to Los Angeles, the split-personality approach he had tapped in late-night Detroit TV sprouted in full bloom on his L.A. series. Even though he had the same furry, kid-friendly puppet sidekicks as always&#x2014;including Pookie the little lion and the giant &#x201c;dogs&#x201d; White Fang and Black Tooth, who, except for their huge paws and arms, were heard but not seen&#x2014;Soupy Sales attracted amazingly A-list adult guests, all of whom lined up eagerly to get cream pies in the face. Bob Hope, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, even Frank Sinatra, all came by to support the show&#x2019;s antic level of anarchy, as well as to get pies in the face.<br><br>Other approaches to children&#x2019;s TV evolved as well, not just from local to national, but in substance as well as style. There were the anything-goes &#x201c;clubhouse&#x201d; shows for children, typified by 1950&#x2019;s Smilin&#x2019; Ed McConnell and His Buster Brown Gang, which bounced around several networks and time slots, with as many titles, throughout the decade. When the host died, his Western sidekick Andy Devine was cast as his replacement, and the series was renamed Andy&#x2019;s Gang. The content remained the same, though, with affable Andy entertaining little kids by reading stories, showing old cartoons and film shorts, and interacting with puppets, including Froggy the Gremlin, who would bedevil poor Andy after being summoned by the same rude-sounding catchphrase uttered by the previous host: &#x201c;Pluck your magic twanger, Froggy!&#x201d; Elsewhere, the vaudeville spirit thrived when channeled, literally, to a children&#x2019;s TV audience, thanks to the wild shenanigans of Pinky Lee, a veteran comic whose Pinky Lee Show, an NBC offering from 1954 to 1956, had him entertaining kids while sporting a bow tie, a checkered suit, and a very childish attitude. Yet another popular children&#x2019;s TV franchise literally became a franchise, with a 1949 Los Angeles show, Bozo&#x2019;s Circus, evolving into Larry Harmon&#x2019;s Bozo the Clown broadcast business model in the mid-1950s, with each local station buying the rights to cast, produce, and present its own Bozo the Clown program.<br><br>Children&#x2019;s TV was full of such shows, emulating the basic formula and energy of Howdy Doody locally and nationally, but there were specialty shows, too. Live-action Westerns and sci-fi shows were big, from 1949&#x2019;s Lone Ranger on ABC to the same year&#x2019;s Captain Video and His Video Rangers on DuMont, a laughably cheap yet impressively durable weekday series that ran until the DuMont network itself collapsed in 1955. Captain Video encouraged its young viewers to sign up and receive special mailings&#x2014;a practice copied by Captain Midnight on CBS, where a quarter and the seal from a jar of Ovaltine would get viewers a special decoder ring, which could be used to decipher special on-air messages.<br><br>From the beginning of network television, in addition to Westerns and science fiction and puppet shows, there was a subcategory of children&#x2019;s shows that could loosely be grouped under the term &#x201c;educational.&#x201d; The earliest of these TV shows for children were offshoots from existing radio programs: NBC&#x2019;s Juvenile Jury, starting on television in 1947, featuring a panel of problem-solving youngsters, and the same network&#x2019;s Quiz Kids, which came to TV via Chicago in 1949 and featured kids answering the same sorts of increasingly tough queries in their chosen categories as adult contestants on The $64,000 Question. Those were shows that tested and rewarded knowledge; other shows set out to impart it.<br><br>These were sincere, gentle shows, in which the hosts talked slowly and sweetly, either directly to the viewers at home or to an in-studio surrogate. The former public school science teacher Don Herbert explored and explained the wonders of science on television for decades, starting with Chicago&#x2019;s Mr. Wizard in 1950, which moved to NBC a year later. Yet another show originating from Chicago, aimed at an even younger audience, was Ding Dong School, hosted by a soft-spoken, matronly hostess identified as Miss Frances. At the time, she was chair of what is now Roosevelt University and felt strongly that the new medium of television had a special responsibility to preschool viewers. She stared straight into the camera and addressed viewers directly, pausing to give them time to answer. &#x201c;Do you remember the three ingredients to the sandwich we made today, besides bread?&#x201d; she asks, waiting patiently for the unheard interactive reply. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Peanut butter. Lettuce. And . . . banana!&#x201d; (Was Elvis watching?) NBC began broadcasting Ding Dong School nationally in 1952, only a few months after it premiered in Chicago.<br><br>Another preschool TV show that broke the fourth wall was Romper Room, which began as a local show in Baltimore in 1953. The producer Bert Claster had the simple but ingenious idea of letting his wife, Nancy, a nursery school teacher, bring her young students into the TV studio to play and work, with youngsters at home invited to watch as part of the action. &#x201c;Miss Nancy&#x201d; would do arts and crafts, sing songs, tell stories, and even advise on proper and improper social behavior, which would earn the classification of a &#x201c;Do-Bee&#x201d; or a &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t-Be.&#x201d; And when, at the end of each show, &#x201c;Miss Nancy&#x201d; held up her magic mirror and looked through it, she would call out names of some of the children she &#x201c;saw&#x201d; watching Romper Room on her TV set. &#x201c;I see Bobby, I see Cindy . . .&#x201d; For the next several decades, Romper Room would be franchised, like Bozo the Clown, with each local TV market presenting its own Miss Somebody. The show&#x2019;s &#x201c;magic mirror&#x201d; gimmick made it seem interactive to young viewers at home, even if your name was never called.<br><br>For interactive TV gimmickry, though, nothing came close to Winky Dink and You, which ran on CBS from 1953 to 1957. It&#x2019;s described in detail in the chapter &#x201c;Animation,&#x201d; but it armed young viewers with a &#x201c;Winky Dink&#x201d; kit&#x2014;a cloth, a box of crayons, and a see-through plastic sheet&#x2014;and encouraged them to draw missing details from the show&#x2019;s animation onto the sheet, which covered the TV screen.<br><br>Of all the programs and people associated with children&#x2019;s and family TV programming in the 1950s, one name rises above all others&#x2014;a man whose name was already established, and beloved, in the world of theatrical cartoons and full-length animated movies and who would very quickly achieve amazing success as host of a prime-time anthology series, co-creator of a daytime children&#x2019;s series, and the visionary behind a wildly popular family theme park. In time, the empire he built would launch its own cable channel for children, purchase and run the ABC network, and establish a powerful cinematic studio operation that, in time, would absorb and present the latest offerings from Pixar, the Muppets, and Star Wars. That man, of course, was Walt Disney, who had made his name with his first Mickey Mouse theatrical cartoon, Steamboat Willie, in 1928. In 1950, the year he first came to television, Disney&#x2019;s big-screen releases included not only a dozen cartoon shorts but the full-length movie Cinderella and the live-action feature Treasure Island. To cap off that very fruitful year, Disney co-hosted, with the ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the dummy sidekick Charlie McCarthy, his first foray into TV: an NBC Christmas Day special called One Hour in Wonderland. The next year, he presented another Christmas Day TV special, this time for CBS, and this time with himself as the sole host: The Walt Disney Christmas Show.<br><br>Disney was eager to get into television because he recognized the value of cross promotion and being able to show clips from, and stoke audience interest for, his upcoming movies. He also had another pet project in mind, a massive theme park, and television could be a major source of both revenue and free publicity. NBC and CBS had already broadcast his Christmas specials, and when he proposed a weekly prime-time series, all the networks, even fledgling, low-rated ABC, were interested. Until that time, the major studios were boycotting television, and to get a regular TV series produced by the Walt Disney Studios would be a breakthrough. What resulted from Disney&#x2019;s interest in TV turned out to be revolutionary for children&#x2019;s programming as well.<br><br>Disney&#x2019;s first regular series on television, produced for ABC, was a 1954 prime-time anthology series called Disneyland, named after a California theme park of his that wouldn&#x2019;t open for another year. The opening installment of Disneyland was little more than a one-hour infomercial, but like almost everything else Disney presented in the 1950s, it caught on quickly and massively. One of the anthology show&#x2019;s first-season offerings was Davy Crockett, a Fess Parker miniseries that sold millions of coonskin caps to impressionable young kids and helped ABC land its first Top 10 series of that decade. By the end of the 1954&#x2013;55 TV season, Disneyland was the No. 6 series on the air, proudly nestled between two long-established CBS hits, Ed Sullivan&#x2019;s Toast of the Town and The Jack Benny Program. And in the last half of 1955, Walt Disney enjoyed two other instant successes: his Disneyland theme park, which opened in July, and a new daytime children&#x2019;s show, which premiered in October and revolutionized children&#x2019;s television significantly.<br><br>THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB<br><br>1955&#x2013;59, ABC. Creators: Walt Disney, Bill Walsh, Hal Adelquist. Host: Jimmie Dodd, aided by Roy Williams. Stars: Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Darlene Gillespie, Cubby O&#x2019;Brien, Karen Pendleton, Doreen Tracey, others.<br><br>To help create The Mickey Mouse Club, Walt Disney turned to Bill Walsh, who had written and produced Disney&#x2019;s two TV holiday specials. For inspiration, he reached back much further into his company&#x2019;s past&#x2014;to 1930, when the success of Mickey Mouse as a theatrical cartoon character had sparked a series of local Mickey Mouse Clubs all over the country. More than two million kids signed up during the Depression before Disney stopped the enterprise, but clearly he never forgot it. In the mid-1950s, ABC, already giddy over the success of Disney&#x2019;s prime-time series Disneyland, asked Walt Disney to produce a weekday children&#x2019;s show for late afternoons. He planned on a fifteen-minute feature, but ABC wanted an hour show, Monday through Friday, and got it.</p><h2>It&#39;s Okay to Be Different (Todd Parr Classics)</h2><p>It&#39;s okay to be a different color.

But beneath the surface, Van Derbur was a troubled young woman who lived through horrific panic attacks and excruciating physical pain every day of her adult life. Starting when she was just a child of five, she was sexually abused by her father until she turned 18. Van Derbur uses the term "incested," eschewing the more vanilla terms of "molestation" or "abuse." <p>As a student and young adult, Van Derbur was an overachiever with an unconscious need to stay very busy. She realizes now this was a coping mechanism to keep her two worlds separated&#x2014;the "night child" who suffered at the hands of her father and the "day child" who was happy and outgoing. </p><p>After being named valedictorian of her high school class, she went on to college. Persuaded to enter a local beauty pageant, she ultimately was crowned Miss America. Ignoring the sheer terror she felt at the prospect of speaking in front of others, Van Derbur went on to become a highly successful motivational speaker. She writes of her endless need to be respected by others, all the while believing that if others really knew who she was, they would hate her and look at her with disdain and disgust. The perfectly poised mask she showed the outside world was a far cry from the tortured, panic-stricken, anxious woman within. The shame she felt within was a constant in her life, reminding her that she was "unworthy." </p><p>When a newspaper reporter learned of her story, Van Derbur's private shame became front-page news. Then she landed on the cover of People magazine. Soon incest survivors from around the country were reaching out to her, desperate to tell someone what had happened to them. It became instantly clear that her new role in life was to help others who had suffered incest and to help teach everyone how to make sure their children are safe from predators.</p>Anyone who knew Marilyn Van Derbur as a child and young adult believed she had it all. Born into an affluent, prominent family, she was a popular, out-standing student and athlete. But beneath the surface, she suffered from horrific panic attacks, unrelenting insomnia and excruciating body pain. No one could imagine that her father &#34;incested&#34; her from age five to 18. Van Derbur was an overachiever with a subconscious need to stay constantly busy. She realizes now that this was a coping mechanism to keep her two worlds separated - the &#34;night child&#34; who suffered at the hands of her father and the &#34;day child&#34; who was happy and accomplished. While a sophomore in college, her sorority sisters nominated her for Miss University of Colorado. Three months later, she was crowned Miss America. Ignoring the sheer terror she felt at the prospect of speaking in front of others, Van Derbur chose motivational speaking as her career and, within a decade, she was named &#34;Outstanding Woman Speaker in America.&#34; Believing people would look at her with disgust and distain if they knew her secret, Van Derbur had an obsessive need to be successful and respected. As her life unfolded, she began to understand the complex ways in which her childhood trauma was driving her adult life. Through dogged persistence and gut-wrenching disclosures and confrontations, she began to heal the gaping wounds of her childhood. When a newspaper reporter learned of her story, Van Derbur&#39;s private shame became front-page news. When she landed on the cover of People magazine, there was a national outpouring from survivors who turned to her for help and support. It became instantly clear that her new role was to help others who had suffered from rape and sexual abuse and to help educate parents on how to keep their children safe from predators.</p><h2>Ciao, Carpaccio!: An Infatuation</h2><p><p><strong>Jan Morris returns to Venice in this loving tribute to one of the great Renaissance masters.</strong></p> In the course of writing <em>Venice</em>, her 1961 classic, Jan Morris became fascinated by the historical presence of a sometimes-overlooked Venetian painter. Nowadays the name of Vittore Carpaccio (1460&#x2013;1520) suggests raw beef, but to Morris it conveyed far more profound meanings. Thus began a lifelong infatuation, reaching across the centuries, between a renowned Welsh writer and a great and delightfully entertaining artist of the early Renaissance. Handsomely designed with more than seventy photographs throughout, <em>Ciao,Carpaccio!</em> is a happy caprice of affection. In illuminating the life of the artist and his paintings, Morris throws in digressions about Venetian animals, courtesans, babies, ships, architecture, and history, and caps it all with thoughtful analyses of Carpaccio&#x2019;s spiritual convictions. Part biography, part art interpretation, part personal odyssey, and all lots of fun, <em>Ciao, Carpaccio!</em> will no doubt help to rescue the name of a noble artist from its popular interpretation as an item of cuisine. 75 color illustrations</p><p>Born in 1926, Jan Morris is the author of such classics as the Pax Britannica trilogy and The World, among many others. She lives in Wales.&#x201c;Morris tackles [the subject] with charm and gusto, infusing this <em>amuse-bouche</em> with vivid examples of the artist&#x2019;s often overlooked eye for detail... We are reminded, quite elegantly, that there is more to Carpaccio than just thin slices of raw beef, some arugula and a drizzle of sauce.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>William D. Cohan, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[H]er enthusiasm is unrivaled and the book will surely delight her many fans.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With a perfect balance between more than 70 color reproductions and Morris&#x2019; pithy and revelatory observations, this is a scintillating and mind-expanding celebration of a profound affinity between two consummate artists of magnanimous curiosity, empathy, and mischief.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Donna Seaman, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Morris lends an overlooked master a fresh lease of imaginative life... By showing us how to look with an inquisitive eye, how to respond as living people, with our own preferences and tastes, she reminds us anew of the purpose and pleasure of art. What she presents is a vignette of human kindness.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rachel Campbell-Johnson, <em>The Times (UK)</em></strong></p><h2>Cain&#39;s Legacy: Liberating Siblings from a Lifetime of Rage, Shame, Secrecy, and Regret</h2><p>Bonds between brothers and sisters are among the longest lasting and most emotionally significant of human relationships. But while 45 percent of adults struggle with serious sibling strife, few discuss it openly. Even fewer resolve it to their satisfaction.&nbsp;In <i>Cain&#x2019;s Legacy</i>, psychotherapist Jeanne Safer, a recognized authority on sibling psychology (and an estranged sister herself) illuminates this pervasive but hidden phenomenon.

Drawing on sixty in-depth interviews with adult siblings struggling with conflicts over money, family businesses, aging parents, contentious wills, unhealed childhood wounds, and blocked communication, Safer provides compassionate guidance to brothers and sisters whose relationship is broken. She helps siblings overcome their paralysis and pain, revealing how they can come to terms with the one peer relationship they can never sever&#x2014;even if they never see each other again.&nbsp;A heartfelt look at a too-often avoided topic, <i>Cain&#x2019;s Legacy </i>is a sympathetic and clear-eyed guide to navigating the darkness separating us from our brothers and sisters.</p><p><b>Jeanne Safer, Ph.D.</b>, has been a psychotherapist for thirty-eight years.

Even something as simple as having a family friend come for a visit can lead to the unexpected, the enchanted, the mysterious -- in this case, the most amazing, most mysterious circus ever.</p><p>From Uncle Krishna's garbled phone message to the fantastic ending, the latest Hall Family Chronicle has all of the earmarks of a Jane Langton novel: fantasy, humor, and magic!</p><p>Join Eleanor, Eddie, Georgie, their new friend Andy, and his twelve very large friends -- more about them later -- in Jane Langton's <strong>The Mysterious Circus</strong>.</p></p><p><p>Jane Langton studied astronomy at Wellesley College and the University of Michigan and did graduate work in art history at the University of Michigan and Radcliffe College. Ms. Langton is the author of a dozen books for young people, including seven other fantasies about the Hall family of Concord, Massachusetts: <em>The Diamond in the Window</em>, <em>The Swing in the Summerhouse</em>, <em>The Astonishing Stereoscope</em>, the Newbery Honor Book <em>The Fledgling</em>, <em>The Fragile Flag</em>, <em>The Time Bike</em>, and <em>The Mysterious Circus</em>. Also well known for her mystery novels for adults, Ms. Langton lives in Lincoln, Massachusetts.</p>Gr. 3-5. Langton, who has lately produced mostly mysteries for adults, offers the seventh installment in her fanciful and venerable Hall Family Chronicles, which debuted with <i>The Diamond in the Window </i>(1962) and went on to win a Newbery Honor for <i>The Fledgling </i>(1980). The setting is still the quaint, present-day community around Walden Pond, and the three Hall siblings continue to expect periodic gifts from their faraway uncle Krishna. This time he sends tiny, carved elephants that miraculously balloon into full-size pachyderms. They are delivered by Krishna's nephew, a juggler, unicyclist, and mystic who recruits neighborhood children to perform under an enchanted big top. Langton's favored transcendentalist themes emerge in a subplot about razing a meadow for a Henry David Thoreau theme park--a travesty that may not rankle Langton's amusement park-loving target audience as much as intended. Although best for readers familiar with the series, this will win its admirers for a narrative that accepts magic as a matter of course, and for the thrilling circus premise. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Born in 1918, L'Engle grew up in New York City, Switzerland, South Carolina and Massachusetts. Her father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist, and their house was always full of musicians and theater people. L'Engle graduated cum laude from Smith College, then returned to New York to work in the theater. While touring with a play, she wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain</i>, originally published in 1945. She met her future husband, Hugh Franklin, when they both appeared in <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. Upon becoming Mrs. Franklin, L'Engle gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children were growing up, she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired from the theater, and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years ran a general store. Her book <i>Meet the Austins</i>, an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960, was based on this experience. Her science fantasy classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was awarded the 1963 Newbery Medal. Two companion novels, <i>A Wind in the Door</i> and <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i> (a Newbery Honor book), complete what has come to be known as The Time Trilogy, a series that continues to grow in popularity with a new generation of readers. Her 1980 book <i>A Ring of Endless Light</i> won the Newbery Honor.

This stems from the need to belong, the most basic of human desires.</p><p>John O'Donohue (<i>Anam Cara</i>), a Celtic poet, scholar, and philosopher with an Irish brogue, speaks to the deepest calling of our soul: the longing to belong. "To be human is to belong," he explains. "Belonging is a circle that embraces everything; if we reject it, we damage our nature. The word 'belonging' holds together the two fundamental aspects of life: Being and Longing, the longing of our Being and the being of our Longing." Although this may sound like an elaborate Celtic circle knot, O'Donohue has nevertheless woven a solid and easy-to-grasp book that speaks to the soul's constant yearning. Every passage is a delight for the senses, as O'Donohue shares his lilting poetic language, his Celtic imagery and stories, and his fireside-chat wisdom. This is a broad-reaching yet highly focused book that dares to explore the realm of legitimate angels, the meaning of suffering, and, most poignantly, how life on earth may never quench the soul's thirst for belonging. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Shows that the eternal values of human life flourish only when we find sanctuary in family, community, &amp; divine relationship</p><h2>Kingdoms of Edward Hicks (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center Series)</h2><p>Examines the historical background, symbolism, and composition of the American painter&#39;s different depictions of &#34;Peaceable Kingdoms&#34;</p><p>Although he is now seen as a progenitor of the "na?ve" style, during his lifetime Edward Hicks (1780-1849) was known only as a devout, impoverished Quaker minister who liked to paint. With a few exceptions, his extant body of work is made up of 62 "Peaceable Kingdom" pictures, based on Isaiah's biblical prophecy. Although these paintings, known for their charmingly wide-eyed and sensuous beasts, use potent color and effective design, they are technically unsophisticated and repetitive in the extreme. But they contain a powerfully serene devoutnessAa mood probably expressed in compensation for Hicks's guilt about an avocation viewed as frivolous by other Quakers. As the popularity of folk art boomed in the early 20th century, Hicks's homely visions were popularized and became the focus of scholarly attention, and this work is probably the best to date. Weekley, the director of museums at Colonial Williamsburg, shrewdly considers Hicks's "secular" life and art through the filter of his intense piety and copiously illustrates her large-format book with brilliant color plates.

Susanna, a fashionable dress-maker whose salon is in quiet Madensky Square, decides on the first spring day to keep a journalto which the reader is privy. The diary records Susanna's concerns, hopes and memories, her succinct, witty and sometimes scathing opinions of her neighbors, customers and rivals, and her generous charity toward those she loves. Susanna's story is not unusual: eloping with a soldier in her teens, she bore a daughter whom she gave up for adoption, an act that is the tragedy of her life.

When a young Polish piano prodigy languishes in neglect, Susanna manipulates the coup that makes Sigi the sweetheart of Europe.

Evocative writing and lush photography clarify Easton's approach to patterns as elements in designing gardens at once inviting and deeply satisfying. The budding garden designer will find help in assessing the site and learning the importance of proportion to harmony, and will be introduced to distinctive ways that rooms and paths, gates and sheltering structures can be incorporated for the most pleasing effects. Destination points are examined as critical to a garden's success. And water features, ornamentation, and plantings are given due attention, showing the power of juxtaposition, and potential for creative innovation. Offering an enticing meditation on why we seek sanctuary in our gardens, Easton sets the stage for an inclusive approach to design regardless of one's chosen garden style; a relevant and appealing guide for gardeners seeking advice, uplift, and wide-ranging options. <i>Alice Joyce</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Beloved by millions, their music changed the world. <i>A Day In The Life</i> is the first serious biography of that music: a hip, intelligent, inside account of how it was created, how it evolved over time, what the Beatles said and did inside the studio while recording it, and what the Beatles themselves thought about what they had wrought. Remarkably, the Beatles released only ten and a half hours of music in their eight-year studio career. Inside the Beatles archives at Abbey Road Studios in London, however, are more than 400 hours of recordings--the rough drafts of the songs the world knows and loves. Mark Hertsgaard became the first outside journalist to gain access to these archives, enabling him to take readers inside the Beatles'creative process like no author before. Part grand survey, part listeners guide, <i>A Day In The Life</i> is one of the most illuminating and factually reliable accounts yet published of the personal and professional influences that shaped the Beatles music. Combining literary analysis and investigative reporting with we.11-paced storytelling and musical explication <i>A Day In The Life</i> offers a fresh, fascinating account of the central people, events, and artistic achievements in the lives of the greatest musicians of our time, the Beatlcs. The opening chapter of <i>A Day In The Life</i> first appeared in the January 24, 1994, issue of <i>The New Yorker</i>, where author Mark Hertsgaard broke the story that Paul, George, and Ringo had begun working together for the first time since the band's break-up in 1970. The results of this collaboration, a video-format Beatles autobiography, along with one or more CDs of previously unissued recordings, are scheduled for release in spring 1995.Somewhere inside London's Abbey Road studios, hidden behind an unmarked, triple-locked, police-alarmed door, are some of the most valuable artifacts of twentieth-century music: the raw tapes of every recording session in the nearly eight-year studio career of the Beatles.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most remarkable facts about the Beatles is that they released only ten and a half hours of music during their years together--the contents of the group's twenty-two singles and fourteen albums.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the tapes inside the Abbey Road archives, it turns out, contain more than four hundred hours' worth of Beatles recordings.<br><br>The collection extends from June 6, 1962, the date of the audition that narrowly persuaded George Martin, a producer at EMI Records, to sign the Beatles, to January 4, 1970, when Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr (John Lennon was in Denmark on holiday) recorded the final overdubs for what amounted to the group's farewell album, <i>Let It Be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>In between are tapes of everything else, stored in red-and-white cardboard boxes the size of large telephone books.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick a favorite Beatles song; the archives hold not only the master tape of that song as it is heard on the album but also the working tapes that trace the song's evolution from its first run-through to its polished final version.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also lots of off-the-cuff jam sessions, arguments, horseplay and studio chat, as well as a few songs the general public has never heard.<br><br>In the course of the research for this book, I was fortunate enough to gain access to these archives on two occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;While on assignment for <i>The New Yorker</i>, I spent the equivalent of six full days inside Abbey Road, listening to fifty hours of tapes of the Beatles and of the solo work of John Lennon.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes felt during those days as though I had been allowed to watch Picasso sketch, and never more so than on the afternoon I listened to all seven takes of "A Day In The Life," the closing song on the <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band </i>album.<br><br>John Lennon recalled <i>Sgt. Pepper </i>as "a peak" in the Beatles' career, a time when "Paul and I were definitely working together, especially on 'A Day in the Life.' " Indeed, "A Day In The Life" may be the ultimate McCartney-Lennon collaboration, a classic example of how the songwriting style of each man perfectly complemented that of the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although John would later confess that he and Paul wrote many songs "eyeball to eyeball," especially in the early days, their usual practice by this time, January 1967, was for one of them to provide the missing middle or accents to a song that the other had already almost completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of "A Day In The Life," it was Paul who made John's composition whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon had the melody and story line--the man who "blew his mind out in a car," the English Army that "had just won the war," the "four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire"--but the song needed something more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon didn't like laboring over songs, preferring instead the Zen purity of inspiration, so when he got stuck after completing the main verses he set the song aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I needed a middle-eight for it [the "middle eight" is the middle of a song where the tune changes before going back to the original verse], but that would have been forcing it," he later explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the rest had come out smooth, flowing, no trouble, and to write a middle eight would have been to write a middle eight, but Paul already had one there."<br><br>Paul did indeed have the fragment "Woke up, fell out of bed..." lying around. The two partners agreed that its peppy portrait of the modern urban life--based on Paul's memories of rushing to school in the morning--made the ideal counterpoint to John's gently ominous, dreamlike commentary on the hollow absurdity of status, order, and worldly attachments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial idea for the song had come, as it so often did with Lennon, from an item in the mass media. "I was reading the paper one day and noticed two stories," he recalled.&nbsp;&nbsp;"One was about the Guinness heir who killed himself in a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the main headline story.&nbsp;&nbsp;He died in London in a car crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next page was a story about four thousand potholes in the streets of Blackburn, Lancashire, that needed to be filled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul's contribution was the beautiful little lick in the song, 'I'd love to turn you on,' that he'd had floating around in his head and couldn't use.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a damn good piece of work."<br><br>The Guinness heir, whom the Beatles had happened to know, was born to a life of fantastic privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;By conventional standards he was "a lucky man who made the grade." He had everything money could buy, but found himself no more immune to death's arbitrary, dispassionate arrival than the lowliest proletarian.&nbsp;&nbsp;A momentary, all too human lapse--"he didn't notice that the lights had changed"--and he was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of death, all delusion is shattered, everyone is equal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon clinches the point with the wistful, mocking epitaph "Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords." The gathered crowd knows they've "seen his face before" but they can't place it; in the broad scheme of things, he is barely a bit player.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth and position that seemed so important, to the heir <i>and </i>the larger society, is revealed as trivial and fleeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally blinded by a different kind of triviality are the bureaucrats of the final verse, who insist on tabulating the precise number of holes in the roads of Blackburn, Lancashire, even "though the holes were rather small." No wonder the singer would "love to turn you on." To see his fellow human beings sleepwalking so numbly through the glorious richness that life offers is heartbreaking.<br><br>Musicologist Wilfrid Mellers has observed that "A Day In The Life" derives much of its power from the contrast between its relatively simple tune and the horrors described in its lyrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is Lennon's <i>voice </i>as much as anything that puts the message across.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 1992 behind-the-scenes documentary <i>The Making of Sgt Pepper, </i>George Martin played an early version of "A Day in the Life." Referring to John, Martin said, "even in this early take, he has a voice which sends shivers down the spine." Martin had just heard Lennon's entranced delivery of the opening lines--"I read the news today, oh boy / About a lucky man who made the grade"--and the deep gaze on his face and the slight glistening in his eyes suggested how moved he still was by the the death of his friend.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Great Alone</h2><p>About the highest stakes a family can face and the bonds that can tear a community apart, this is a novel as spectacular and powerful as Alaska itself.

She grew up in Collegeville, PA, and traveled extensively before settling on Nantucket, which has been the setting for her seven previous novels. Hilderbrand is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the graduate fiction workshop at the University of Iowa.Katie Hale portrays four close-knit Nantucket couples, the MacAvoys, Kapenashes, Drakes, and Wheelers, who call one another &#34;the Castaways.&#34; Hale&#39;s depiction of their complex relationships, including their sharing of children and marriage partners, is believable, although some aspects of the story are maudlin. When the MacAvoys set sail alone for Martha&#39;s Vineyard to celebrate their anniversary, tragedy strikes--and the question of murder arises. Hale&#39;s stylistic portrayals give each character a distinct voice and a credible set of circumstances. However, the plot is somewhat overdone, and the novel would be better as an abridgment. Solving the mystery of the couple&#39;s death is the most compelling part. G.D.W. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Nureyev: The Life</h2><p>Rudolf Nureyev had it all: beauty, genius, charm, passion, and sex appeal. No other dancer of our time has generated the same excitement, for both men and women, on or off the stage. With <i>Nureyev: The Life,</i> Julie Kavanagh shows how his intense drive and passion for dance propelled him from a poor, Tatar-peasant background to the most sophisticated circles of London, Paris, and New York. His dramatic defection to the West in l961 created a Cold War crisis and made him an instant celebrity, but this was just the beginning. Nureyev spent the rest of his life breaking barriers: reinventing male technique, &#x201c;crashing the gates&#x201d; of modern dance, iconoclastically updating the most hallowed classics, and making dance history by partnering England&#x2019;s <i>prima ballerina assoluta</i>, Margot Fonteyn--a woman twice his age. He danced for almost all the major choreographers--Frederick Ashton, George Balanchine, Kenneth MacMillan, Jerome Robbins, Maurice B�jart, Roland Petit--his main motive, he claimed, for having left the Kirov. But Nureyev also made it his mission to stage Russia&#x2019;s full-length masterpieces in the West. His highly personal productions of <i>Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, Raymonda, Romeo and Juliet, </i>and<i> La Bayad�re</i> are the mainstays of the Paris Op�ra Ballet repertory to this day. An inspirational director and teacher, Nureyev was a Diaghilev-like mentor to young prot�g�s across the globe--from Karen Kain and Monica Mason (now directors themselves), to Sylvie Guillem, Elisabeth Platel, Laurent Hilaire and Kenneth Greve. <br><br>Sex, as much as dance, was a driving force for Nureyev. From his first secret liaison in Russia to his tempestuous relationship with the great Danish dancer Erik Bruhn, we see not only Nureyev&#x2019;s notorious homosexual history unfold, but also learn of his profound effect on women--whether a Sixties wild child or Jackie Kennedy and Lee Radziwill or the aging Marlene Dietrich. Among the first victims of AIDS, Nureyev was diagnosed HIV positive in 1984 but defied the disease for nearly a decade, dancing, directing the Paris Op�ra Ballet, choreographing, and even beginning a new career as a conductor. Still making plans for the future, Nureyev finally succumbed and died in January l993.<br><br>Drawing on previously undisclosed letters, diaries, home-movie footage, interviews with Nureyev&#x2019;s inner circle, and her own dance background, Julie Kavanagh gives the most intimate, revealing, and dramatic picture we have ever had of this dazzling, complex figure.</p><p>Julie Kavanagh is the author of <i>Secret Muses: The Life of Frederick Ashton,</i> which won the Dance Perspectives Foundation de la Torre Bueno Prize. She trained in ballet before taking up a career in journalism and has been Arts Editor of <i>Harpers &amp; Queen, </i>a dance critic for <i>The Spectator</i>, and London Editor of both <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>. She lives in London with her husband and two sons.<b>Chapter 1: A Vagabond Soul</b>Early one morning when six-year-old Rosa Kolesnikova woke up, she remembered first of all that she was on the train, and then she noticed the three Nureyev girls sitting on the bunk opposite. The toddler was whimpering, and her eight-year-old sister was trying to comfort her. She saw to her annoyance that her friend Lilia, who was also six, had taken her toy and was clutching it. Their mother was nowhere to be seen. Something was going on. In the corridor people were rushing back and forth talking excitedly, but no one would say what was happening. Later she noticed that next door there were sheets curtaining off the Nureyev compartment and doctors in white coats were going in and out. <i>Tyotya</i>-Farida must be ill. Throughout the morning, making some excuse, she and the other children walked by to see if they could peek through a crack in the screen of sheets, but her mother would call them back and try to distract them. &#x201c;Look, Lake Baikal! Lake Baikal! Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful?&#x201d; she cried.It was a cold, clear morning, and the lake, a sunlit ocean of ice, seemed to merge with the far-off white mountain ridges of Khamar Daban. For most of the day the train traveled along the southwestern shore beneath sheer cliffs and steep woods, offering sudden dazzling views of Baikal as it threaded through the tunnels. With its legend of the vengeful Old Man Baikal, who hurled a huge rock at his runaway daughter, the lake was a wonder for children: Its size alone was breathtaking&#x2014;four hundred miles long and one mile deep in the middle. By late afternoon, however, its fascination had worn off, and everyone was glad to get to the Mongolian city of Ulan-Ude, where the train stopped for several hours.Almost all the passengers went into town to shop in the trading arcades and the poplar-lined main street, Leninskaya Ulitsa. When they returned, one or two of the women came up to the children with a large box and told them to look inside. There they saw a tiny baby swaddled tightly: &#x201c;We bought him in Ulan-Ude,&#x201d; they said, laughing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little Tatar brother for the Nureyev girls!&#x201d; Rosa found this hard to believe. It didn&#x2019;t make sense that a Tatar child would be for sale in a place full of people who looked so foreign, with their big foreheads and slanting eyes. Besides, before they arrived, she had heard the adults talking about a new baby on the train. Rosa had a six-month-old brother of her own, but even so she was full of envy of the Nureyev sisters and tremendously excited. &#x201c;We were all in ecstasies, and in the carriage there was such jubilation! It was like a holiday, with everyone happy and wanting to share in the celebration.&#x201d;Word of the event spread quickly, and for the rest of the day people crowded into the carriage to see the new arrival: Rudolf Nureyev&#x2019;s first audience. His birth, he would later say, was the most romantic event of his life, symbolic of his future statelessness and nomadic existence. It was to be a life lived mostly en route to places, navigated by what he called his &#x201c;vagabond soul.&#x201d; To Rosa he was never Rudolf or even Rudik, its diminutive, but <i>Malchik kotoriy rodilsay v poezde</i> said in one breath as a name: The-boy-who-was-born-on-a-train.The order for the soldiers&#x2019; families to leave had come suddenly. Almost full term in her pregnancy, Farida Nureyev knew she was taking a risk by traveling at this stage, but she had had no choice. For the last two months, Farida and Ekaterina, Rosa&#x2019;s mother, had regularly gone together to the authorities to find out when they were going to be permitted to join their husbands, who were serving in the Red Army&#x2019;s Far Eastern Division. One delay had followed another until at last, at the beginning of March 1938, the wives were told that a military train would be leaving that night.The children were asleep by the time the trucks arrived, and after waking them and bundling them in blankets, Farida left the barracks of Alkino, her home for the past nine months, and started for the station in Ufa, about forty kilometers away, where the train was waiting. There were two carriages set aside for the women and children, and a special wagon for their luggage. The compartments opened straight onto the corridor without the privacy of doors, but they were clean and quite comfortable, with an unoccupied single row of bunks on the opposite side, which all the children on the train immediately converted into a play area. &#x201c;It was the best of times! There was such a spirit of adventure and excitement.&#x201d; Most of the wives were young, already friends, and delighted to be going to their husbands, whom they hadn&#x2019;t seen for several months. They were all very kind and solicitous toward Farida, making sure she had everything she needed, and each day one of the two doctors on board would come and check up on her.The train traveled at varying speeds, sometimes racketing along, sometimes stopping for hours while waiting to be hooked up to another engine. At stations there was usually a straggle of <i>babushki</i> selling little piles of wares&#x2014;scallions, pickled gherkins, curds, smoked fish&#x2014; but the women rarely bought anything, as the soldiers appointed to take care of them brought them provisions as well as hot water for tea and for washing. The children would have liked to get out and run along the platform, but their mothers were reluctant to let them go: They never knew when the train was going to leave. After nearly two weeks of traveling, everyone was growing restless, &#x201c;Is the Far East far?&#x201d; became the children&#x2019;s endless refrain. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why the day the little boy was born stuck in the memory. Given all the monotony, expectation, and boredom, you couldn&#x2019;t forget such an event in a lifetime.&#x201d;Rudolf Nureyev was &#x201c;shaken out of the womb&#x201d; as the train ran alongside Lake Baikal around midday on March 17, 1938. Farida was euphoric. Not only was the baby born safely, but at last she had the son her husband longed for. When the train stopped in Ulan-Ude, she asked one of the women to accompany her eldest daughter, also called Rosa, a solemn, responsible girl, to send a telegram to her husband, Hamet, with the news, even though she felt sure he wouldn&#x2019;t believe it. Once before, when her second daughter, Lilia, was born, Farida had sent word that she had given birth to a boy&#x2014;&#x201c;She lied because she longed to make him happy,&#x201d; Rudolf wrote in his memoir. It is far more likely, however, that as Hamet&#x2019;s work kept him away for long periods, her motive was to persuade him to return to their village. If so, it worked. &#x201c;Overjoyed, Father came home on leave as soon as he could and found out that the &#x2018;boy&#x2019; was Lida [Lilia]. He was speechless and utterly miserable.&#x201d;By 1938 Farida had been married to Hamet for nearly nine years, although they had spent much of that time apart. When they first met, in the city of Kazan in the late twenties, he was still a student, studying Tatar philology and the new ideology of Communism at the academy there. He was not then the rigid army officer he later became, but a debonair young man full of ambition and ideals. A studio portrait of Hamet at twenty-five, dressed in pinstripe trousers, dress shirt, and bow tie, shows him sitting at a caf� table with an equally handsome friend, cigarette in hand; they look like a pair of Parisian flaneurs. Two years younger than Hamet and also of slight build, Farida herself was extremely attractive, with long sleek black hair parted in the middle, and dark round eyes. She rarely laughed, but had a quiet sense of humor that showed in her wry, closed smile: &#x201c;It came from inside as in a Rembrandt picture.&#x201d; Although she had no education, she was bright and, like Hamet, self-confident and proud, giving relatives the impression that they both considered themselves a touch above their families.The couple could not have chosen a more romantic place for their courtship than Kazan, with its elegant arcades and parks, and its skyline of minarets. There was a summer theater, a bandstand and chairs, the beautiful fountain encircled with birch trees in the Lyadskoy Gardens, and the limestone-white kremlin on the hill from which one could look down at the boats far below on the Kazanka River. They both retained their nostalgia for the city, and years later would sing such Kazakh duets together as the &#x201c;Tower of Kazan,&#x201d; a plaintive ballad about the Tatar queen who chose to jump to her death from its upper terrace rather than forsake her birthplace. Before the revolution, Kazan had ninety-one houses of worship&#x2014; monasteries, mosques, and cathedrals&#x2014;but by 1928, when Hamet and Farida were living there, many had been demolished by the Bolsheviks or were being used as administrative and storage buildings. Although brought up as Muslims&#x2014;Hamet&#x2019;s father was a mullah&#x2014;both were now party members, having been more than willing to exchange their religious beliefs for faith in the Communist regime. For them, as Rudolf said, the revolution was &#x201c;a miracle,&#x201d; opening up the possibility of educating themselves and sending their children to university, an opportunity previously undreamed of by peasant families.Tugulbay, where Farida was born in 1905, was a large, relatively wealthy Tatar village near Kazan. Most households had a cow, but her parents, the Agilivulyevni, were poor, as there were four daughters and only one son to work the land. Farida&#x2019;s brother, Valiula, was fifteen years older than she, and when their mother and father died during the typhus epidemic, he took her and her three sisters&#x2014;Gafia, Gandalip, and Sharide&#x2014;to live with his family in the city. Valiula&#x2019;s second wife, who was much younger than her husband, resented the sudden arrival of the four girls and loaded them with domestic chores. He, on the other hand, was kind and caring, and did everything he could to make them happy. Valiula had a phonograph and encouraged his ...</p><h2>Burgundy: A Comprehensive Guide to the Producers, Appellations, and Wines</h2><p>A guide to the wines of Burgundy lists 640 growers and producers of wine and discusses the overall quality of the wines</p><p></p><h2>Touch the Art: Pop Warhol&#39;s Top</h2><p>It&#x2019;s pop, <i>with a twist</i> a fun collection of works by such 20th century masters as Warhol, Lichtenstein, and Hockney that turns the art world into a fingertip sensation.

This engaging, insightful narrative reveals, for the first time, the lives and work of the real advertising men and women of that era. Just as portrayed in the series, these creative people were the stars of the real Madison Avenue. Their innate eccentricity, vanity, and imagination meant their behavior and lifestyle was as candid and original as their advertising. They had it and they flaunted it. People like Bill Bernbach, George Lois, Ed McCabe, Mary Wells, Marion Harper, Julian Koenig, Steve Frankfurt, and Amil Gargano, and others, who in that small space, in that short time, created some of the most radical and influential advertising ever and sparked a revolution in the methods, practice, and execution of the business.

But during her final semester, her father, the Abhorsen, goes missing, and Sabriel knows she must enter the Old Kingdom to find him. She soon finds companions in Mogget, a cat whose aloof manner barely conceals its malevolent spirit, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage long imprisoned by magic, now free in body but still trapped by painful memories. As the three travel deep into the Old Kingdom, threats mount on all sides. And every step brings them closer to a battle that will pit them against the true forces of life and death -- and bring Sabriel face-to-face with her own hidden destiny.</p><p>With <em>Sabriel</em>, the first installment in the Abhorsen trilogy, Garth Nix exploded onto the fantasy scene as a rising star, in a novel that takes readers to a world where the line between the living and the dead isn't always clear -- and sometimes disappears altogether.</p></p><p>After receiving a cryptic message from her father, Abhorsen, a necromancer trapped in Death, 18-year-old Sabriel sets off into the Old Kingdom. Fraught with peril and deadly trickery, her journey takes her to a world filled with parasitical spirits, Mordicants, and Shadow Hands. Unlike other necromancers, who raise the dead, Abhorsen lays the disturbed dead back to rest. This obliges him--and now Sabriel, who has taken on her father's title and duties--to slip over the border into the icy river of Death, sometimes battling the evil forces that lurk there, waiting for an opportunity to escape into the realm of the living. Desperate to find her father, and grimly determined to help save the Old Kingdom from destruction by the horrible forces of the evil undead, Sabriel endures almost impossible exhaustion, violent confrontations, and terrifying challenges to her supernatural abilities--and her destiny. <p> Garth Nix delves deep into the mystical underworld of necromancy, magic, and the monstrous undead. This tale is not for the faint of heart; imbedded in the classic good-versus-evil story line are subplots of grisly ghouls hungry for human life to perpetuate their stay in the world of the living, and dark, devastating secrets of betrayal and loss.

But now her father, the Charter-Mage Abhorsen, is missing, and to find him Sabriel must cross back into that world. With Mogget, whose feline form hides a powerful, perhaps malevolent spirit, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage, Sabriel travels deep into the Old Kingdom. There she confronts an evil that threatens much more than her life--and comes face-to-face with her own hidden destiny.</p><h2>Your Key to Sports Success</h2><p>From the rear cover of this 411 page book: &#34;Whether an athlete or not, you are the subject of this book because you fall into one of 16 inborn Brain Types found in all people the world over.

She is a syndicated newspaper columnist (&#x201c;The Dinner Diva&#x201d;), a certified nutritionist, and the host of SavingDinner.com. Ely has a weekly &#x201c;Food for Thought&#x201d; column on the ever-popular FlyLady.net website, as well as her own e-zine, Healthy Foods. She is the author of <i>Saving Dinner, Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way, Saving Dinner for the Holidays</i>, and <i>Saving Dinner Basics.</i> She lives in North Carolina with her two teenage children.INTRODUCTION<br> &nbsp;<br> A long time ago (about twenty-five years), in a world far, far away (one could say that about the 1980s), lived a young woman (that would be me) who decided (because of a man) to go vegetarian. Although there were countless vegetarian cookbooks available, the young woman instead opted for convenience and ate countless peanut butter sandwiches (natural peanut butter on whole-grain bread, mind you) and drank many a Dos Equis beer (no comment) with her paramour into the wee hours of the night. It was when she put on a hefty fifteen pounds that she decided being a vegetarian wasn&#x2019;t for her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fast forward to the twenty-first century. While I haven&#x2019;t become a full-fledged vegetarian twenty-plus years later, I do understand that the weight gain I experienced back then had to do with the robust nightly peanut butter sandwiches (yes, plural) and beers (also plural). And though my eating persuasion has stayed a more omnivorous course up to this point, I do recognize the value of eating vegetarian.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vegetarianism used to be a 1970s tofu-Birkenstock-hippie experience that one eventually outgrew, as maturity and a more conventional life came into being. At least, that was the old way of looking at things.<br> &nbsp;<br> But things have changed enormously in the last thirty-plus years. With as many as twenty-five million Americans calling themselves vegetarians, vegetarianism has gone mainstream, big time. The number of people becoming and staying vegetarian continues to grow, for a variety of reasons. From health concerns over Mad Cow disease, to ethical concerns about the way stock animals are raised, to the antibiotics, growth hormones, and the other stuff that goes into producing meat&#x2014; all have contributed to a changed mind-set about &#x201c;going veggie.&#x201d; No longer is vegetarianism associated with a quirky group of fringe folk. Today&#x2019;s vegetarians are the more ordinary people you meet every day, from all walks of life, choosing to live meatless: the family down the street, your doctor, the gal checking your groceries at the supermarket, and your babysitter, perhaps.<br> &nbsp;<br> Regardless of one&#x2019;s affiliation with or without meat, the interest in vegetarian cooking, even part-time vegetarianism, and the demand from my readers are what propelled this book into being. Saving Dinner the Vegetarian Way is for all who are curious about how to cook veggie, who are trying to figure out ways to bring a family member&#x2019;s newfound vegetarianism to the dinner table, and who want a less meat-centered way of eating.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vegetarianism, no matter how you define it&#x2014;lacto (milk products allowed), ovo (eggs a-ok), lacto-ovo (yes to both), vegan (ix-nay on all animal products and for some this also means honey from bees)&#x2014;offers an amazing array of delicious foods from every cultural and ethnic persuasion. And, as great fortune would have it, many of these fine dishes are quick and easy to prepare and do not require a trip to an obscure ethnic market or a day off from life to cook supper. This is easy, doable food for your busy family, done in the Saving Dinner tradition of offering you a balanced six-day weekly menu with different recipes, the itemized shopping list, and suggested side dishes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seeing families get back to the family dinner table has long been a passion of mine, and for many families, &#x201c;going vegetarian&#x201d; is a viable option, either part- or full-time. Saving Dinner the Vegetarian Way will certainly give you the tools to do it, plus keep your dinnertime engaging and its participants happy when the meal comes around, and that&#x2019;s what this book is truly all about.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Care and Feeding of a Vegetarian<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s interesting, from my perspective as a nutritionist, how many people assume that just because they&#x2019;re vegetarians they are automatically eating &#x201c;more nutritiously.&#x201d; This is far from true. The daughter of a dear friend of mine freaks me out&#x2014;she won&#x2019;t touch vegetables, eats macaroni and cheese by the boatload, and has a big list of things she won&#x2019;t eat that have nothing to do with anything carnivore. She&#x2019;s just picky and her nutrition is atrocious! Another friend&#x2019;s friend thinks that because he&#x2019;s a vegetarian, he can drink unlimited martinis! Well, okay ... gin and vodka would categorically fit into the vegetarian part of the food chain. However, grain alcohol will never count as a nutrient, whether you&#x2019;re a vegetarian or not.<br> &nbsp;<br> In order to be the healthiest you can be, you should try to put away as many veggies each day as possible (not knock back as many martinis as possible). Salads should be excuses to cram in every vegetable from broccoli to zucchini, and this exercise should be done daily. Vegetables should be consumed in mass quantities&#x2014;this is how healthy people live regardless of their affiliation with meat.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the big concern for vegetarians is getting adequate amounts of protein. Like a lot of things in life, there is a formula for this. Keep in mind that you need to get about 15 percent of your daily calories from protein. Mathematically, that means you multiply your weight by 0.37 grams of protein to find out what your needs are. If you weigh 130 pounds, that would be 130 � .37 = 48 grams of protein needed per day. See how easy that is?<br> &nbsp;<br> Nutrition labels are wonderful for helping you calculate how much you&#x2019;re getting, plus a few tricks like combining grains and beans will help you get higher counts and more complete proteins.<br> &nbsp;<br> HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br> &nbsp;<br> Saving Dinner the Vegetarian Way is designed to give you everything you need to do dinner, as do my other Saving Dinner books. The recipes, serving suggestions, and, most important, categorized shopping lists are all contained within these pages. For your convenience, the grocery lists are also on the website, www.savingdinner.com, in an easy printable format.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ingredients needed for the Serving Suggestions recipes are asterisked (**) on the grocery lists because I don&#x2019;t want you to feel obligated to follow any of my suggestions. I will tell you, however, that they are there for two reasons: (1) they are simple and delicious; (2) they help balance the nutrient count for the meal. So if you want to use them, great! If they don&#x2019;t strike your fancy, ignore them.<br> &nbsp;<br> I strongly suggest you read the recipes before you hit the grocery store each week with the list. It helps to understand what you will be cooking that week before you head out the door to invest your hard-earned money in food from the grocery store. Those five minutes of reading through the recipes may help you make a quick decision if your store is out of something or you would prefer a substitute. You can&#x2019;t do that if you don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re shopping for!<br> &nbsp;<br> And like my other books, this book is crammed full of sidebars&#x2014;read them! There is a ton of information to help you take full advantage of these menus and to make the recipes your own. As I was writing these recipes, I would think of something else that would empower you in the kitchen, and so I made a sidebar of the idea. The more equipped and knowledgeable you are, the faster you&#x2019;re able to make the recipes and do the shopping, and that makes your efforts worthwhile.<br> &nbsp;<br> When appropriate, I have added Do Ahead Tips to help make cooking dinner quicker the next day (e.g., soaking the beans, precooking rice, potatoes, etc.). However, there are all kinds of things you can do the day before, if you so desire. I kept it basic; you might want to do more&#x2014;it&#x2019;s totally up to you. You also can move days around if you want; just remember that the &#x201c;Do Ahead&#x201d; tips may no longer be appropriate if you do.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you do want to make substitutions (accounting for allergies, preferences, etc.) on some of the grocery items, feel free! Maybe you and broccoli don&#x2019;t get along, but you love cauliflower; change it! Chances are good that the recipe will still work (maybe better&#x2014;you just never know!). So, even though all the work of planning a menu has already been done for you, the Serving Suggestions are based on the season, and the grocery list is categorized, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that you can&#x2019;t make any changes.

Now, in her masterly, haunting new novel, she recreates a seminal moment in modern African history: Biafra&#x2019;s impassioned struggle to establish an independent republic in Nigeria during the 1960s. <br><br>With the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Adichie weaves together the lives of five characters caught up in the extraordinary tumult of the decade. Fifteen-year-old Ugwu is houseboy to Odenigbo, a university professor who sends him to school, and in whose living room Ugwu hears voices full of revolutionary zeal. Odenigbo&#x2019;s beautiful mistress, Olanna, a sociology teacher, is running away from her parents&#x2019; world of wealth and excess; Kainene, her urbane twin, is taking over their father&#x2019;s business; and Kainene&#x2019;s English lover, Richard, forms a bridge between their two worlds. As we follow these intertwined lives through a military coup, the Biafran secession and the subsequent war, Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise, and intimately, the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place.<br>Epic, ambitious and triumphantly realized, <b>Half of a Yellow Sun</b> is a more powerful, dramatic and intensely emotional picture of modern Africa than any we have had before.</p><p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was born in Nigeria. <b>Purple Hibiscus</b> won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best First Book and the Hurston/Wright Legacy award. It was also shortlisted for the Orange Prize and the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. Her short fiction has appeared in <i>Granta</i> and the <i>Iowa Review</i>, among other literary journals, and she received an O. Henry Prize in 2003. She is a 2005/2006 Hodder fellow at Princeton University and divides her time between the U.S. and Nigeria.Master was a little crazy; he had spent too many years reading books overseas, talked to himself in his office, did not always return greetings, and had too much hair. Ugwu's aunty said this in a low voice as they walked on the path. "But he is a good man," she added. "And as long as you work well, you will eat well. You will even eat meat every day." She stopped to spit; the saliva left her mouth with a sucking sound and landed on the grass.<br><br>Ugwu did not believe that anybody, not even this master he was going to live with, ate meat <i>every day</i>. He did not disagree with his aunty, though, because he was too choked with expectation, too busy imagining his new life away from the village. They had been walking for a while now, since they got off the lorry at the motor park, and the afternoon sun burned the back of his neck. But he did not mind. He was prepared to walk hours more in even hotter sun. He had never seen anything like the streets that appeared after they went past the university gates, streets so smooth and tarred that he itched to lay his cheek down on them. He would never be able to describe to his sister Anulika how the bungalows here were painted the color of the sky and sat side by side like polite well-dressed men, how the hedges separating them were trimmed so flat on top that they looked like tables wrapped with leaves.<br><br>His aunty walked faster, her slippers making <i>slap-slap</i> sounds that echoed in the silent street. Ugwu wondered if she, too, could feel the coal tar getting hotter underneath, through her thin soles. They went past a sign, ODIM STREET, and Ugwu mouthed <i>street</i>, as he did whenever he saw an English word that was not too long. He smelled something sweet, heady, as they walked into a compound, and was sure it came from the white flowers clustered on the bushes at the entrance. The bushes were shaped like slender hills. The lawn glistened. Butterflies hovered above.<br><br>"I told Master you will learn everything fast, <i>osiso-osiso</i>," his aunty said. Ugwu nodded attentively although she had already told him this many times, as often as she told him the story of how his good fortune came about: While she was sweeping the corridor in the mathematics department a week ago, she heard Master say that he needed a houseboy to do his cleaning, and she immediately said she could help, speaking before his typist or office messenger could offer to bring someone.<br><br>"I will learn fast, Aunty," Ugwu said. He was staring at the car in the garage; a strip of metal ran around its blue body like a necklace.<br><br>"Remember, what you will answer whenever he calls you is <i>Yes, sah</i>!"<br><br>"Yes, sah!" Ugwu repeated.<br><br>They were standing before the glass door. Ugwu held back from reaching out to touch the cement wall, to see how different it would feel from the mud walls of his mother's hut that still bore the faint patterns of molding fingers. For a brief moment, he wished he were back there now, in his mother's hut, under the dim coolness of the thatch roof; or in his aunty's hut, the only one in the village with a corrugated iron roof.<br><br>His aunty tapped on the glass. Ugwu could see the white curtains behind the door. A voice said, in English, "Yes? Come in."<br><br>They took off their slippers before walking in. Ugwu had never seen a room so wide. Despite the brown sofas arranged in a semicircle, the side tables between them, the shelves crammed with books, and the center table with a vase of red and white plastic flowers, the room still seemed to have too much space. Master sat in an armchair, wearing a singlet and a pair of shorts. He was not sitting upright but slanted, a book covering his face, as though oblivious that he had just asked people in.<br><br>"Good afternoon, sah! This is the child," Ugwu's aunty said.<br><br>Master looked up. His complexion was very dark, like old bark, and the hair that covered his chest and legs was a lustrous, darker shade. He pulled off his glasses. "The child?"<br><br>"The houseboy, sah."<br><br>"Oh, yes, you have brought the houseboy.<i> I kpotago ya</i>." Master's Igbo felt feathery in Ugwu's ears. It was Igbo colored by the sliding sounds of English, the Igbo of one who spoke English often.<br><br>"He will work hard," his aunty said. "He is a very good boy. Just tell him what he should do. Thank, sah!"<br><br>Master grunted in response, watching Ugwu and his aunty with a faintly distracted expression, as if their presence made it difficult for him to remember something important. Ugwu's aunty patted Ugwu's shoulder, whispered that he should do well, and turned to the door. After she left, Master put his glasses back on and faced his book, relaxing further into a slanting position, legs stretched out. Even when he turned the pages he did so with his eyes on the book.<br><br>Ugwu stood by the door, waiting. Sunlight streamed in through the windows, and from time to time a gentle breeze lifted the curtains. The room was silent except for the rustle of Master's page-turning. Ugwu stood for a while before he began to edge closer and closer to the bookshelf, as though to hide in it, and then, after a while, he sank down to the floor, cradling his raffia bag between his knees. He looked up at the ceiling, so high up, so piercingly white. He closed his eyes and tried to reimagine this spacious room with the alien furniture, but he couldn't. He opened his eyes, overcome by a new wonder, and looked around to make sure it was all real. To think that he would sit on these sofas, polish this slippery-smooth floor, wash these gauzy curtains.<br><br>"<i>Kedu afa gi?</i> What's your name?" Master asked, startling him.<br><br>Ugwu stood up.<br><br>"What's your name?" Master asked again and sat up straight. He filled the armchair, his thick hair that stood high on his head, his muscled arms, his broad shoulders; Ugwu had imagined an older man, somebody frail, and now he felt a sudden fear that he might not please this master who looked so youthfully capable, who looked as if he needed nothing.<br><br>"Ugwu, sah."<br><br>"Ugwu. And you've come from Obukpa?"<br><br>"From Opi, sah."<br><br>"You could be anything from twelve to thirty." Master narrowed his eyes. "Probably thirteen." He said <i>thirteen</i> in English.<br><br>"Yes, sah."<br><br>Master turned back to his book. Ugwu stood there. Master flipped past some pages and looked up. "<i>Ngwa,</i> go to the kitchen; there should be something you can eat in the fridge."<br><br>"Yes, sah."<br><br>Ugwu entered the kitchen cautiously, placing one foot slowly after the other. When he saw the white thing, almost as tall as he was, he knew it was the fridge. His aunty had told him about it. A cold barn, she had said, that kept food from going bad. He opened it and gasped as the cool air rushed into his face. Oranges, bread, beer, soft drinks: many things in packets and cans were arranged on different levels and, and on the topmost, a roasted shimmering chicken, whole but for a leg. Ugwu reached out and touched the chicken. The fridge breathed heavily in his ears. He touched the chicken again and licked his finger before he yanked the other leg off, eating it until he had only the cracked, sucked pieces of bones left in his hand. Next, he broke off some bread, a chunk that he would have been excited to share with his siblings if a relative had visited and brought it as a gift. He ate quickly, before Master could come in and change his mind. He had finished eating and was standing by the sink, trying to remember what his aunty had told him about opening it to have water gush out like a spring, when Master walked in. He had put on a print shirt and a pair of trousers. His toes, which peeked through leather slippers, seemed feminine, perhaps because they were so clean; they belonged to feet that always wore shoes.<br><br>"What is it?" Master asked.<br><br>"Sah?" Ugwu gestured to the sink.<br><br>Master came over and turned the metal tap. "You should look around the house and put your bag in the first room on the corridor. I'm going for a walk, to clear my head, <i>i nugo?</i>"<br><br>"Yes, sah." Ugwu watched him leave through the back door. He was not tall. His walk was brisk, energetic, and he looked like Ezeagu, the man who held the wrestling record in Ugwu's village.<br><br>Ugwu turned off the tap, turned it on again, then off. On and off and on and off until he was laughing at the magic of the running water and the chicken and bread that lay balmy in his stomach. He went past the living room and into the corridor. There were books piled on the shelves and tables in the three bedrooms, on the sink and cabinets in the bathroom, stacked from floor to ceiling in the study, and in the store, old journals were stacked next to crates of Coke and cartons of Premier beer. Some of the books were placed face down, open, as though Master had not yet finished reading them but had hastily gone on to another. Ugwu tried to read the titles, but most were too long, too difficult. <i>Non-Parametric Methods</i>. <i>An African Survey</i>. <i>The Great Chain of Being</i>. <i>The Norman Impact Upon England</i>. He walked on tiptoe from room to room, because his feet felt dirty, and as he did so he grew increasingly determined to please Master, to stay in this house of meat and cool floors. He was examining the toilet, running his hand over the black plastic seat, when he heard Master's voice.<br><br>"Where are you, my good man?" He said <i>my good man</i> in English.<br><br>Ugwu dashed out to the living room. "Yes, sah!"<br><br>"What's your name again?"<br><br>"Ugwu, sah."<br><br>"Yes, Ugwu.

The subprime disaster? How about mad cow disease? Each new crisis makes us worry until we forget and start worrying about the next one. Many of us found ourselves stranded in crowded airports, ruined by vanishing pension funds, or anxious about tucking into a yummy beef steak. When something goes wrong, we are told that the way to prevent further crisis is better technology, more laws, and bigger bureaucracy. How to protect ourselves from the next financial crisis? Stricter regulations, more and better advisers. How to protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism? Homeland security, full body scanners, further sacrifice of individual freedom. How to counteract exploding costs in health care? Tax hikes, rationalization, better genetic markers.</p><p>One idea is absent from these lists: risk-savvy citizens. And there is a reason.</p><p>&#x201c;Human beings are fallible: lazy, stupid, greedy and weak,&#x201d; an article in the <i>Economist</i> announced.1 We are said to be irrational slaves to our whims and appetites, addicted to sex, smoking, and electronic gadgets. Twenty-year-olds drive with their cell phones glued to their ears, oblivious to the fact that doing so lowers their reaction time to that of a seventy-year-old. A fifth of Americans believe that they are in the top 1 percent income group and just as many believe that they will soon be there. Bankers have little respect for people&#x2019;s ability to invest money, and some doctors tell me that most of their patients lack intelligence, making it pointless to disclose health information that might be misunderstood in the first place. All of this points to the conclusion that Homo sapiens (&#x201c;man the wise&#x201d;) is a misnomer. Something has gone wrong in our genes. Evolution seems to have cheated us with shabby mental software and miswired our brains. In short, John and Jane Q. Public need continuous guidance, as a child needs a parent. Although we live in the high-tech twenty-first century, some form of paternalism is the only viable strategy: Close the doors, collect the experts, and tell the public what&#x2019;s best for them.</p><p>This fatalistic message is not what you will read in this book.2 The problem is not simply individual stupidity, but the phenomenon of a <i>risk-illiterate society</i>.</p><p>Literacy&#x2014;the ability to read and write&#x2014;is the lifeblood of an informed citizenship in a democracy. But knowing how to read and write isn&#x2019;t enough. <i>Risk literacy </i>is the basic knowledge required to deal with a modern technological society. The breakneck speed of technological innovation will make risk literacy as indispensable in the twenty-first century as reading and writing were in previous centuries. Without it, you jeopardize your health and money, or may be manipulated into unrealistic fears and hopes. One might think that the basics of risk literacy are already being taught. Yet you will look in vain for it in most high schools, law schools, medical schools, and beyond. As a result, most of us are risk illiterate.</p><p>When I use the general term <i>risk savvy</i> I refer not just to risk literacy, but also more broadly to situations where not all risks are known and calculable. Risk savvy is not the same as risk aversion. Without taking risks, innovation would end, as would fun, and courage would belong to the past. Nor does risk savvy mean turning into a reckless daredevil or BASE jumper, denying the possibility of landing on one&#x2019;s nose. Without a beneficial degree of caution, humans would have ceased to exist long ago.</p><p>You might think, why bother if there are experts to consult? But it isn&#x2019;t that simple. Bitter experience teaches that expert advice may be a dangerous thing. Many doctors, financial advisers, and other risk experts themselves misunderstand risks or are unable to communicate them in an understandable way. Worse, quite a few have conflicts of interest or are so afraid of litigation that they recommend actions to clients they would never recommend to their own families. You have no choice but to think for yourself.</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to invite you into the world of uncertainty and risk, beginning with weather reports and a very humble hazard, getting soaked.</p><p>Chances of Rain</p><p>A weathercaster on U.S. television once announced the weather this way:</p><p>The probability that it will rain on Saturday is 50 percent. The chance that it will rain on Sunday is also 50 percent. Therefore, the probability that it will rain on the weekend is 100 percent.</p><p>Most of us will smile at this.3 But do you know what it means when the weather report announces a 30 percent chance of rain tomorrow? 30 percent of what? I live in Berlin. Most Berliners believe that it will rain tomorrow 30 percent <i>of the time</i>; that is, for seven to eight hours. Others think that it will rain in 30 percent <i>of the region</i>; that is, most likely not where they live. Most New Yorkers think both are nonsense. They believe that it will rain on 30 percent <i>of the days</i> for which this announcement is made; that is, there will most likely be no rain at all tomorrow.4</p><p>Are people hopelessly confused? Not necessarily. Part of the problem is the experts who never learned how to explain probabilities in the first place. If they clearly stated the class to which a chance of rain refers, the confusion would disappear. Time? Region? Days? What meteorologists intend to say is that it will rain on 30 percent of the days for which this prediction is made. And &#x201c;rain&#x201d; refers to any amount above some tiny threshold, such as 0.01 inches.5 Left on their own, people intuitively fill in a reference class that makes sense to them, such as how many hours, where, or how heavily it rains. More imaginative minds will come up with others still. As one woman in New York said, &#x201c;I know what 30 percent means: Three meteorologists think it will rain, and seven not.&#x201d;</p><p>Here is my point. New forecasting technology has enabled meteorologists to replace mere verbal statements of certainty (&#x201c;it will rain tomorrow&#x201d;) or chance (&#x201c;it is likely&#x201d;) with numerical precision. But greater precision has <i>not</i> led to greater understanding of what the message really is. The confusion over probabilities of rain has persisted in fact since the very first time they were broadcast to the public in 1965 in the United States. This confusion is not just limited to rain, but occurs whenever a probability is attached to a single event&#x2014;such as &#x201c;if you take an antidepressant, you have a 30 percent chance of developing a sexual problem.&#x201d; Does that mean that 30 percent of all people will develop a sexual problem, or that you yourself will have a problem in 30 percent of your sexual encounters? The solution to clearing this widespread and long-standing muddle is surprisingly simple:</p><p>Always ask for the reference class: Percent of what?</p><p>If weathercasters were taught how to communicate to the public, you wouldn&#x2019;t even have to ask.</p><p>Getting soaked is a minor risk, although for some, from the farmer to Ferrari, the chances of rain matter. Before the Formula 1 Grand Prix, one of the most-discussed issues is the weather forecast&#x2014;choosing the right tires are the key to winning the race. The same holds for NASA: The weather forecast is essential for approving or canceling a space shuttle launch, as the Challenger disaster tragically illustrates. Yet for most of us, all that is at stake is canceling a family outing unnecessarily or getting wet feet. People may not make a special effort to understand chances of rain simply because the hazards are modest. Are we more risk savvy when something truly important is at stake?</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Figure 1-1. </b>What does a &#x201c;30 percent chance of rain tomorrow&#x201d; mean? Some believe it will rain tomorrow 30 percent of the time (upper panel). Others believe it will rain tomorrow in 30 percent of the region (middle panel). Finally, some believe that three meteorologists think that it will rain and seven do not (lower panel). What meteorologists in fact intend to say is something different: that it will rain on 30 percent of the days for which this announcement is made. The problem is not simply in people&#x2019;s minds, but in the failure of experts to state clearly what they mean.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pill Scare</p><p>Great Britain has many traditions, one of them being the contraceptive pill scare. Since the early 1960s, women are alarmed every couple of years by reports that the pill can lead to thrombosis, potentially life-threatening blood clots in the legs or lungs. In the most famous scare, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines issued a warning that third-generation oral contraceptive pills increased the risk of thrombosis twofold&#x2014;that is, by 100 percent. How much more certain can you get? This terrifying information was passed on in &#x201c;Dear Doctor&#x201d; letters to 190,000 general practitioners, pharmacists, and directors of public health and was presented in an emergency announcement to the media. Alarm bells rang around the country. Distressed women stopped taking the pill, which caused unwanted pregnancies and abortions.6</p><p>Just how big is 100 percent? The studies on which the warning was based had shown that of every seven thousand women who took the earlier, second-generation pill, about one had a thrombosis; and that this number increased to two among women who took third-generation pills. That is, the <i>absolute risk</i> increase was only one in seven thousand, whereas the <i>relative risk </i>increase was indeed 100 percent. As we see, in contrast to absolute risks, relative risks appear threateningly large and can cause a great stir. Had the committee and the media reported the absolute risks, few women would have panicked and dropped the pill. Most likely, no one would have even cared.</p><p>This single scare led to an estimated thirteen thousand (!) additional abortions in the following year in England and Wales. But the fallout lasted for longer than one year. Before the alert, abortion rates had been steeply on the decline, but afterward, this trend was reversed and abortion rates increased for years to come. Women&#x2019;s confidence in oral contraceptives was undermined, and pill sales fell sharply. Not all unwanted pregnancies were aborted; for every abortion there was also one extra birth. The increase in both abortions and births was particularly pronounced among girls under sixteen, with some eight hundred additional conceptions.</p><p>Ironically, pregnancies and abortions are associated with a risk of thrombosis that exceeds that of the third-generation pill. The pill scare hurt women, hurt the National Health Service, and even brought down the stocks of the pharmaceutical industry. The resulting increase in costs to the National Health Service for abortion provision has been estimated at �4&#x2013;6 million. Among the few who profited were the journalists who got the story on the front page.</p><p>An unwanted pregnancy and abortion is not something to be taken lightly. As one woman reports:</p><p>When I learned that I was pregnant, my partner and I were together for two years. His first reaction was: &#x201c;Come back when it&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d; I threw him out and tried to find a solution. I wanted so much to begin with college. I fought for building a future for us, but I began to realize there was none. The one thing I did not want was to become dependent on the government, or&#x2014;even worse&#x2014;on a man. Therefore I decided last minute for an abortion. It&#x2019;s now two days ago, and I have one nervous breakdown after the other. My mind says, it was the best decision, but my heart weeps.</p><p>The tradition of pill scares continues to the present day, and always with the same trick. The solution is not better pills or more sophisticated abortion technology, but risk-savvy young women and men. It would not be so difficult to explain to teenagers the simple distinction between a relative risk (&#x201c;100 percent&#x201d;) and an absolute risk (&#x201c;one in seven thousand&#x201d;). After all, batting averages and other sports statistics are common knowledge for many, young and old. Yet to the present day journalists have succeeded in causing scares with BIG numbers, and the public predictably panics, year after year.</p><p>Once again, the remedy is a simple rule:</p><p>Always ask: What is the absolute risk increase?</p><p>Journalists are not the only ones who play on our emotions with the help of numbers. Top medical journals, health brochures, and the Internet also inform the public in terms of relative changes, because bigger numbers make better headlines. In 2009 the prestigious <i>British Medical Journal</i> published two articles on oral contraceptives and thrombosis: One made the absolute numbers transparent in its abstract, while the other again touted relative risks, reporting that &#x201c;oral contraceptives increased the risk of venous thrombosis fivefold.&#x201d;7 The &#x201c;fivefold&#x201d; increase of course made for more spectacular headlines, and some newspapers, such as the <i>London Evening Standard</i>, didn&#x2019;t even bother mentioning the absolute numbers.<i> </i>As a rule, although we have high-tech medicine, understandable information for patients and doctors remains the exception.</p><p>It should be the ethical responsibility of every editor to enforce transparent reporting and it should be on the agenda of every ethics committee and every department of health. But it is not. After publication of my book <i>Calculated Risks</i>, which explains how to help both the public and doctors understand numbers, the neuroscientist Mike Gazzaniga, then dean of the faculty at Dartmouth College, paid me a visit. Outraged by the tricks played on the public by the use of relative risks and other means, he said that he would propose this issue to the ...</p></p><h2>Exploring Complexity: An Introduction</h2><p>Unexpected discoveries in nonequilibrium physics and nonlinear dynamics are changing our understanding of complex phenomena.

This Immeasurable Place continues the inspiring story of how two women-chef-co-owners Blake Spalding and Jennifer Castle-started their award-winning, Buddhist-based, farm-to-table restaurant in a tiny, traditionally Mormon town on the edge of the magnificent Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Filled with seventy new recipes; gorgeous images by world-famous photographer Ace Kvale; and stories of the restaurant, organic farm, and town, This Immeasurable Place is much more than a cookbook. It&#39;s a food-justice primer, a guide to eating consciously, and a meditation on connecting community to land and table.</p><p>"Blake Spalding and Jen Castle are alchemists, truly changing the world through their hands, their hearts, their farm, their food. In community, everything is possible. Theirs is a leadership of love."&nbsp;-- Terry Tempest Williams, author of<i>&nbsp;The </i><i>Hour of Land.</i>NPR: On Point's Best Books of 2017<br><br>"...

The story of Blake and Jen, true kitchen sisters -- their cooking, friendship, and farming--is expansive and illuminating. Land, food, family, stewardship, and spirit all course through these tempting, gorgeous pages. A book that feeds us on&nbsp;so many levels." --&nbsp;Davia&nbsp;Nelson, NPR's <i>Kitchen Sisters&nbsp;</i><br><br>"There was so much to dig into--profiles of all the characters who work in and around the stunningly remote Utah farm-restaurant, plus "Blake's Fun Facts from the Henhouse," Jen's family food memories, and good lord, Ace Kvale's photos--that I was more inclined to curl up with the book than to spring into action." -- <i>Every Day with Rachael Ray </i><br><br>"This Immeasurable Place is as much for curling up in a chair and lapsing into Southwestern reveries as it is about cooking.

In this beautifully illustrated book legions of fans can now discover the story of Cadfael's entry into the monastery at Shrewsbury and the chain of events that led him into the Benedictine Order. These three tales show Cadfael at the height of his sleuthing form, with all the complexities of plot, vividly evoked Shropshire backgrounds and warm understanding of the frailties of human nature that have made Ellis Peters an international bestseller.</p><p>Ellis Peters was a pseudonym of Edith Pargeter, OBE. As Ellis Peters she was the bestselling author of twenty Brother Cadfael Chronicles and the illustrated short story collection A Rare Benedictine. Under her own name she wrote numerous critically acclaimed historical novels including A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury and The Brothers of Gwynedd Quartet. She was the recipient of the Crime Writer&#39;s Association and Cartier Diamond Dagger Award. She died in 1995.What better introduction to Ellis Peters's classic mysteries than this trio of stories introducing her well-loved medieval sleuth, Brother Cadfael? Beginning with Cadfael's transformation from crusading warrior to Benedictine monk and moving through devious doings at Shrewsbury Abbey, Stephen Thorne's narrative enhances the liveliness and detail of Peters's evocative characters and settings. As Cadfael blends herbal poultices in his apothecary, so Thorne's delivery blends clearly defined delivery with just the right proportions of vocal drama to yield a reading of rare enjoyment. While actor Derek Jacobi's version of Brother Cadfael on PBS's "Mystery" series presents a ready picture for the eye, the pure ear appeal of Cadfael's rolling Welsh burr in this recording provides a pleasure far more lingering.

He has also published a collection of holiday tales for adults, <i>Our Simple Gifts</i>. Born in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania, Parry lives and writes in northern Virginia.Grave robbing and witches provide the atmospheric overture as Maj. Abel Jones, agent for Abraham Lincoln, investigates the murder of a Northern general in his fifth suspenseful adventure. In the preceding novel, Honor's Kingdom, the diminutive Welshman was in England working for the Union's interests, but here he returns home to "dear Pottsville" in Pennsylvania. Jones must journey deeper into coal country when Gen. Carl Stone, who had been recruiting Irish miners for the Union army, is found slain. The confessed killer has died of cholera, but a cautionary check of his grave finds interred instead the body of a young woman who has been stabbed to death. The intrigue thus triggered brings Jones up against a mad priest, local witch women and the tight-knit society of the Irish mining community (among its members is Black Jack Kehoe, later notorious in the Molly Maguires). Complicating the investigation are clues pointing to Russia and schemes for world revolution from the prewar years when the general went by the name of Carl von Steinbrock. Inevitably the investigation returns to the Irish immigrants, "Those famine lads cut loose to find their keep, in a world that did not want them or their kind." With this latest novel, the pseudonymous Parry-otherwise known as Ralph Peters, the author of thrillers (The Devil's Garden) and policy-wonk nonfiction (Beyond Terror: Strategy in a Changing World)-ably advances his series of historical fiction. The usual amusing observations of his tight-laced hero and a rousing finale set during the grim battle of Fredericksburg are sure to please his devoted following. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Haynes Honda Shadow VT600 &amp; 750 Owners Workshop Manual: 1988 thru 2003</h2><p>Each Haynes Manual is based on a complete teardown and rebuild of the specific vehicle.

But there are problems everywhere. His fellow shepherds are misbehaving, which makes their director, Mrs. Elkins, yell at all of them; the girl he likes is playing Mary opposite a Joseph who is depressingly smart, athletic, and cute; the family dog is doing very poorly, and they have no idea what they&#x2019;re going to tell Doug&#x2019;s little sister, Becky, who&#x2019;s playing one of the Host of Angels and who loves the dog more than anything; and his dad&#x2019;s just gotten a flat tire, which means they might not even get to the pageant after all.<br><br> But Christmas is a time of miracles. And for Doug and his family, this will be the most miraculous Christmas of all.</p><p>From 1983 to 2004,&nbsp;<b>Dave Barry</b>&nbsp;wrote a weekly humor column for&nbsp;<i>The Miami Herald</i>, which in 1988 won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. He is the author of more than thirty books, including such bestsellers as the nonfiction&nbsp;<i>Live Right and Find Happiness (Although Beer Is Much Faster)</i>,&nbsp;<i>You Can Date Boys When You're Forty</i>, and&nbsp;<i>I'll Mature When I'm Dead</i>; the novels&nbsp;<i>Big Trouble</i>,&nbsp;<i>Tricky Business</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Insane City</i>; the very successful YA Peter Pan novels (with Ridley Pearson); and his Christmas story&nbsp;<i>The Shepherd, the Angel, and Walter the Christmas Miracle Dog</i>. Two of his books&#x2014;<i>Big Trouble</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Dave Barry's Guide to Guys</i>&#x2014;have been turned into movies. For a while, his life was even a television series,&nbsp;<i>Dave's World</i>, but then it was canceled. The series. Not the life. For many years, Dave was also a guitarist with the late, infamous, and strangely unlamented band the Rock Bottom Remainders.What do you tell your little sister when her dog dies on Christmas Eve? In the Christmas extravaganza, is it better to be a shepherd or a "Three King"? What do you do when a ton of bat poop breaks through the floor of the church belfry and drops on your sweetheart? This child's first-person account of a Christmas pageant gone awry reminds one of Jean Shepherd's classic A CHRISTMAS STORY. However, Barry's reading is flat and a bit rushed. He steps on his jokes. Yet the risible situations--as when the hero's dad disguises the dog's corpse as part of a cr che--manage to shine through.

And my grandmother&#x2019;s spine started causing her excruciating pain.<br> <br>Furthermore, random bad smells emanated from we knew not where. And my brother, Jaz, became cursed with invisibility. Nobody noticed him except us. His best friend had moved away, and he did not know a single boy to hang around with. Even our cousins looked the other way when they saw him at our annual Christmas party. They didn&#x2019;t even seem to be snubbing my brother; they just didn&#x2019;t see him.<br> <br>The thing about luck is that it&#x2019;s like a fever. You can take fever meds and lie in bed and drink chicken broth and sleep seventeen hours in a row, but basically your fever will break when it wants to break.<br> <br>In early April my parents got a call from Japan. Three elderly relatives were getting ready to die and wanted my parents to take care of them in their last weeks and months. There was nothing surprising about this. This was just the way our year was going. It was April 25 when my grandparents and Jaz delivered my parents to the airport to catch their plane to Japan. I stayed at home because the type of malaria I&#x2019;d gotten was called &#x201c;airport malaria.&#x201d; Airport malaria is when a rogue mosquito from, say, Africa has been inadvertently carried into the United States on a jet. This infected mosquito might bite you. I got bit in Florida last summer, and I lived in Kansas. The chances that I would get malaria from going to the airport in Kansas were remote, but I&#x2019;d grown so scared of mosquitoes that sometimes I didn&#x2019;t even like stepping outside. It really wasn&#x2019;t fair&#x2014;I was only twelve, and yet already I was scared of the entire outside world.<br> <br>During the 1940s there were thousands of malaria cases in the United States. Then in the fifties the experts thought malaria here was eradicated. But every so often, someone still caught it. Sometimes you would get your picture in the newspaper. My picture was even in Time magazine!<br> <br>Obaachan and Jiichan, my grandmother and grandfather on my mother&#x2019;s side, were both sixty-seven and lived with us in Littlefield, Kansas. &#x201c;Obaachan&#x201d; was more formal than &#x201c;Baachan,&#x201d; but it was what she wanted Jaz and me to call her.<br> <br>When harvest season arrived in May of our horrible year, Jiichan planned to come out of retirement to work as a combine driver for a custom harvesting company called Parker Harvesting, Inc. (I&#x2019;ll explain about custom harvesting in a minute or two.) My grandmother would work as a cook for the same harvester, with me as her helper.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d all worked for the Parkers before. But it was the first time my parents wouldn&#x2019;t be there, which meant only my grandparents would be paying the mortgage during harvest this year. I didn&#x2019;t quite understand what &#x201c;paying the mortgage&#x201d; meant, but apparently, it was a constant struggle. Another phrase that came up a lot was &#x201c;paying down the principal,&#x201d; as in, &#x201c;If we could just pay down the principal, I&#x2019;d feel like we were getting somewhere.&#x201d; I used to think that &#x201c;paying down the principal&#x201d; meant they wanted to bribe the principal at one of my future schools, like they would give this principal some money, and then someday the principal would let me into high school despite my iffy grades.<br> <br>Anyway. As soon as my grandparents got home from dropping off my parents, changes were implemented. My mother had told Jaz, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. You&#x2019;ll make a friend when you least expect it.&#x201d; My grandparents were more proactive. It seems Obaachan and Jiichan had a bright idea they&#x2019;d been hiding from us.<br> <br>Obaachan made Jaz and me sit on the floor in front of the coffee table while she and Jiichan sat on the couch. &#x201c;We having meeting-party,&#x201d; she announced regally. &#x201c;We invite boys we will consider for friendship with Jaz.&#x201d; She turned to me. &#x201c;Make list with him. I no interfere.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A list of people to invite?&#x201d; I asked. My Doberman, Thunder, tried to push himself between me and the table. I pushed back, and we just sat there, leaning hard into each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;No! A list!&#x201d; she snapped at me.<br> <br>Wasn&#x2019;t that what I had just said? I finally got up and moved to a different side of the table. Still unsure what she wanted, I got a pen and paper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pencil! You may need to erase.&#x201d;<br> <br>I got a pencil and readied myself. &#x201c;Should I number the list?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>My grandfather nodded sagely. &#x201c;Agenda,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;List for boys we invite, agenda for party.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No interfere!&#x201d; Obaachan said to Jiichan.<br> <br>&#x201c;You interfere first!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br> <br>Obaachan and Jiichan had been married for forty-nine years, and my mother always said that after that number of years, you no longer had to be polite all the time. It sometimes seemed that in our house, I was the only one who had to use my manners. Jaz didn&#x2019;t have to because he had issues. When I&#x2019;m sixty-seven, in fifty-five years, I supposed that I would finally be able to dispense with my manners.<br> <br>I thought Jiichan and Obaachan talked to each other the way that they did because they&#x2019;d had an arranged marriage. Obaachan said that if I had an arranged marriage, I would never give or receive a broken heart. If I grew up beautiful, I would never break any man&#x2019;s heart, and if I grew up plain, nobody would break my heart. If I rebelled and wanted love, however, all bets were off. Broken hearts would come my way like locusts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Summer! You in rah-rah land.&#x201d; She never said &#x201c;la-la land,&#x201d; and I never corrected her.<br> <br>I hurriedly wrote Number one on the paper in the left-hand margin.<br> <br>&#x201c;No number,&#x201d; Obaachan said. &#x201c;Arrange by time. I have to tell you everything?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jiichan picked up the paper, studied the Number one, and set the paper back down. &#x201c;I agree. Arrange by time.&#x201d;<br> <br>I erased the Number one and wrote in One o&#x2019;clock p.m. I made sure not to flick the eraser bits onto the floor, because if I did, Obaachan would be so upset that she might fall over dead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Noon!&#x201d; barked Obaachan. I made the change. &#x201c;Continue. First write day on top of paper in big letter. Day for meeting is next Saturday. Then continue.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What would you like to do at noon?&#x201d; I asked Jaz.<br> <br>&#x201c;Play with LEGOs. I want a LEGO party.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really party,&#x201d; Jiichan said. He was cleaning his teeth with the floss he always carried in his shirt pocket. Sometimes he flossed during dinner, right at the table. See what I mean about manners? Can you imagine what your parents would do if you started to floss at the dinner table? But he constantly seemed to have something between his teeth. &#x201c;More of meeting than party,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Noon lunchtime,&#x201d; Obaachan said. &#x201c;You feed boys first. Boys always hungry. Never mind. I no interfere. But no food, no friend. What I just say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No food, no friend,&#x201d; Jaz and I repeated. Obaachan sometimes made us repeat something she had just said, to prove we were listening.<br> <br>Jaz turned to Obaachan. &#x201c;Obaachan, will you make sandwiches?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Summer make. I her mentor.&#x201d;<br> <br>I found myself already starting to feel stressed. What if I made ham sandwiches and the boys wanted tuna fish? What if I used regular bread and one of the boys needed gluten-free, like my friend Alyssa had to eat because of her allergies? What if I used too much mayonnaise? Arghhh!<br> <br>Still, next to Noon I wrote Sandwich eating.<br> <br>Jiichan pounded on the paper. &#x201c;Lunch!&#x201d; he cried out passionately. &#x201c;Not &#x2018;sandwich eating&#x2019;! It called &#x2018;lunch&#x2019;!&#x201d; He clutched at his heart. &#x201c;You kids go to kill me.&#x201d; Apparently, about once every couple of weeks, he thought we were going to kill him.<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of sandwiches would you like?&#x201d; I asked Jaz, still worrying about those. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to make the wrong kind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask around at school. I can&#x2019;t believe this is happening. I&#x2019;m really going to have a meeting-party.&#x201d; He got up to look at himself in a mirror over our fake fireplace and said, &#x201c;You are going to have a meeting-party.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jiichan was now standing and staggering away from us with his hands on his heart. Jaz and I watched him calmly. &#x201c;I die, scatter ashes,&#x201d; Jiichan said. &#x201c;No keep in hole in wall at cemetery. You hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Jiichan,&#x201d; we said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. Then I die happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wrote down LEGOs, one o&#x2019;clock. My brother had approximately one thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of LEGOs. Seriously. I counted once. LEGOs were one of our biggest expenses and the only thing we splurged on.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good plan!&#x201d; Jiichan said. &#x201c;That brilliant!&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t tell if he was being sarcastic as he peered over my shoulder from his death throes.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long is the meeting-party?&#x201d; Jaz asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think most parties are two hours,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;So I guess that&#x2019;s the end of the agenda?&#x201d; Nobody answered, so I made a line underneath the agenda and laid down the pencil.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who should I invite?&#x201d; Jaz asked. &#x201c;Should it be just kids who I think might come, or should it be kids who might not come but on the other hand you never know? Should it be just kids in my class, or should it be all the kids in my grade? Should it be boys and girls or just boys? Should it be only kids who might not even know who I am even though I know who they are? Should it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Jiichan held up his palm to quiet Jaz. &#x201c;Invite whole fifth grade,&#x201d; he said wisely. We all looked at him, and he nodded. &#x201c;That way hurt nobody&#x2019;s feelings.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jaz stared at him doubtfully for a moment, but then his face turned from doubtful to ecstatic. I could almost hear him thinking, Wow, the whole school might come to my meeting-party!<br> <br>Then my grandparents wanted Jaz to draw invitations. He was a good artist in kind of a weird way. Like, he never drew pictures of anything recognizable, but if you needed a totally psychedelic design, he was your man. But he wanted to buy invitations because he thought they were more official. We ended up driving thirty miles to a 99-cent store in a larger town. After loud and passionate debate, we bought several boxes of dinosaur invitations. On Monday, Jaz distributed them to all the kids in the fifth grade at his school.<br> <br>So as not to jinx the party, we weren&#x2019;t supposed to talk to one another about it. But we could pray all we wanted, in front of several sprigs of silk cherry blossoms on the coffee table. We did this the night before the party. Cherry blossoms, as the harbingers of spring, were important to Japanese farmers. My grandmother mumbled in Japanese as I knelt beside her. I could make out a word occasionally&#x2014;like unmei for &#x201c;destiny.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Obaachan muttered on, I prayed in my head: Please let my brother have a successful meeting-party. Let the kids have fun, let him make at least one friend, preferably two. Please, please, please.<br> <br>That night I drew in my notebook like I always did. I didn&#x2019;t draw very well, so each picture took me weeks. I copied them from photographs of mosquitoes I found.<br> <br>One time I thought I had a perfect drawing, so I sent it to a mosquito expert, and this is what he said: &#x201c;Looks like an Anopheles, but the proboscis is &#x2018;hairy&#x2019; and the palps look like a thin line, so this is not a good representation, but could easily be changed (make palps more than a line and get rid of bristle on mouthparts and you have an Anopheles female). The problem is that most (but not all) Anopheles in the U.S. tend to have spots on their wings, which these drawings lack.&#x201d; Wow, epic fail on my part!<br> <br>It was strange because I knew that if I had almost been killed by a car, I wouldn&#x2019;t have become fascinated with cars. If I had almost drowned, I wouldn&#x2019;t have become obsessed with water. But the more I looked at mosquitoes, even the same type that had infected me, the more delicate they seemed. Fragile, even. And yet one had almost taken my life. It was like now we couldn&#x2019;t be separated. I mean, if I saw one on my arm, I wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to smash it or even run screaming down the highway. They terrified me. But still, we were inseparable.</p><h2>Tangible Kingdom Primer (Missio Publishing)</h2><p>Everyone is talking about community. Everyone seems to want it, but most struggle to find it. <p> Matt and Hugh have written The Tangible Kingdom Primer with two specific purposes. First, to be a spiritual formation tool to prepare your heart for mission. We want you to grab a few friends to go through this with, there is no big commitment required to becoming an incarnational community. You can simply be friends going through an 8 week spiritual exercise together. You can challenge each other as you build a community, and you will have a much better experience as you process your struggles together. </p><p> The second purpose is to be a field guide for starting mission together. Some of you are ready to go and have friends that want to go with you. If that is you, then dive right into the Primer as both spiritual formation and missional practice. </p><p> In either case, at the end of the eight weeks, you will have the opportunity to decide what to do next. Remember, this is just a Primer to begin building lifelong habits. Some of you will just thank each other and move on. Others will decide to formalize your missional community as you go on mission together. There is no failure here, just a chance to create your own incarnational community. </p><p> The Tangible Kingdom Primer is an 8 week, daily Workbook/Journal that will help you define new terminology, inspire the imagination with full-color graphic design work, and provoke new missional practices naturally. A great resource for existing churches, small groups, or new communities.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Violinist&#39;s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code (Thorndike Press Large Print Nonfiction Series)</h2><p>An exploration of human DNA and the stories it can tell describes how genes can explain why JFK&#39;s skin was bronze, Einstein was a genius, and why people with exceptional thumb flexibility can become world-class violinists.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2012</strong>: Born to parents named Gene and Jean, Sam Kean got enough ribbing in school science classes to develop an early aversion to genetics. Lucky for us, curiosity overcame conditioning as he became increasingly fascinated with the role DNA plays in shaping destiny. As he did in <em>The Disappearing Spoon</em>, a captivating chronicle of human interactions with each periodic element, Kean has created another page-turning scientific history in <em>The Violinist&#x2019;s Thumb</em>. With fluid gusto, he turns the discovery of DNA into riveting human drama, then unfurls a series of anecdotes that expand our understanding of genetic influence on our lives as (sometimes uniquely gifted) individuals, from presidents to physicists to violin virtuosos with exceptionally dexterous digits. Kean illuminates clues embedded in our genes that help map the meandering trajectory of our species, then leaves readers with the distinct impression that all this has been a fantastic preamble to our species&#x2019; most thrilling (and likely chilling) chapter: manipulating our DNA to remake future humans, and all life on Earth. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em>Sam Kean is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Disappearing Spoon</i>.

Otherwise what was it all for?&#x201d;</em></p><p>In 2006, after his father was killed, Gulwali Passarlay was caught between the Taliban who wanted to recruit him, and the Americans who wanted to use him. To protect her son, Gulwali&#x2019;s mother sent him away. The search for safety would lead the twelve-year-old across eight countries, from the mountains of eastern Afghanistan through Iran and Europe to Britain. Over the course of twelve harrowing months, Gulwali endured imprisonment, hunger, cruelty, brutality, loneliness, and terror&#x2014;and nearly drowned crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Eventually granted asylum in England, Gulwali was sent to a good school, learned English, won a place at a top university, and was chosen to help carry the Olympic Torch in the 2012 London Games.</p><p>In <em>The Lightless Sky</em>, Gulwali recalls his remarkable experience and offers a firsthand look at one of the most pressing issues of our time: the modern refugee crisis&#x2014;the worst displacement of millions of men, women, and children in generations. Few, like Gulwali, make it to a country that offers the chance of freedom and opportunity. A celebration of courage and determination, <em>The Lightless Sky</em> is a poignant account of an exceptional human being who is today an ardent advocate of democracy&#x2014;and a reminder of our responsibilities to those caught in terrifying and often deadly circumstances beyond their control.</p></p><p><p>After Gulwali Passarlay&#x2019;s father and grandfather were killed by U.S. troops for allegedly cooperating with the Taliban, he fled Afghanistan with his brother in the middle of the night with only a hastily packed rucksack and little more than two hundred dollars in his pocket. He was twelve years old, and this is his story. </p><p>Told in unflinching and unforgettable detail, <em>The Lightless Sky</em> is at once an utterly absorbing personal history and the defining story of the modern refugee experience, a stunning testament to the power of the human spirit; the triumph of faith, courage, and determination; and the undeniable universal right to life, liberty, and security of person.</p><p>Trafficked by an international cartel of smugglers through Pakistan&#x2019;s treacherous Waziristan and Peshawar regions and the desolate outposts of Iran, Gulwali eventually reached Izmir, Turkey, then on to Bulgaria, where he disembarked for Greece on a dangerously overcrowded boat that spent two days being battered and nearly capsizing before Gulwali and the more than one hundred other refugees onboard finally touched ground&#x2014;soaked, starving, and exhausted. From Athens, Gulwali trekked through Italy, Belgium, Germany, and finally France, where he was stranded for a month in the Jungle, a notorious makeshift refugee camp outside the port city of Calais, while waiting to cross the Channel for England, his final destination. </p><p>The first book to tell the modern refugee crisis from a firsthand perspective, <em>The Lightless Sky</em> is an unforgettable chronicle of Gulwali&#x2019;s yearlong odyssey from Afghanistan to England, during which he traveled more than twelve thousand miles, escaped internment in Turkey and Bulgaria, negotiated passage with shadowy agents in the smuggling trade, and struggled to settle mentally and emotionally in England long after his physical journey came to an end. By sharing his story, Gulwali brings to life the plight of the sixty million refugees and internally displaced people around the world who continue to risk their lives in pursuit of freedom, equality, and a better life, despite innumerable and unimaginable hardships and endless humiliations, because, as the poet Warsan Shire reminds us, &#x201c;no one leaves home unless home chases you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A heart-rending read that illuminates the plight of unaccompanied minors forced to leave their homes and loved ones. It is beautifully written in simple, accessible prose. Rarely does Passarlay display self-pity and his fierce intelligence is apparent throughout. He also sheds light on the nefarious world of the smugglers who treat their human cargo with so little compassion....A testament to the courage of all those fleeing conflict in search of safety.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>The Independent</em></p><p>&#x201c;A powerful account of a yearlong journey....[a] life that was almost snuffed out so prematurely is now bursting with promise.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>The Times</em> (London)</p><p>&#x201c;Be brave. This is for your own good.&#x201d; And then my mother said something that froze my heart. </p><p>&#x201c;However bad it gets, don&#x2019;t come back.&#x201d;</p><p>Gulwali Passarlay was sent away from Afghanistan as a young boy, fleeing the conflict that had claimed his father&#x2019;s life. After an extraordinarily tortuous journey across eight countries, Gulwali arrived in the United Kingdom a year later and has most recently devoted his new life to education. Now twenty-one years old, he is set to graduate from the University of Manchester with a degree in politics. Gulwali is a member of many prestigious political, aid, and youth groups, each a stepping-stone to his ultimate goal: to run for the presidency of Afghanistan.</p></p><h2>Great Wood Finishes</h2><p>Finishing wood surfaces can be tricky and time-consuming, and all that effort and time may not yield the beautiful product envisioned at the start.

The home they made there, and its effect on their work, is the subject of these searching, lyrical vignettes by the critic and poet Robert Long.<br><br>Pollock moved to Springs because he thought he wanted to stop drinking, but he found a connection to nature there that inspired some of the most significant paintings of our time. Others followed him. When Fairfield Porter bought a house in Southampton, the New York School suddenly had a new headquarters, and James Schuyler and Frank O'Hara found companionship and raw material for their poems on South Main Street and on the three-hour train ride between the city and the East End. Willem de Kooning rode his bike every day between his studio in the East Hampton woods and the bay, where the light informed every brushstroke he put to canvas from the early 1960s on. <br><br>In <i>De Kooning's Bicycle,</i> Long mixes storytelling with history to re-create the lives and events that shaped American art and literature as we know it today, in a landscape where town met country and the modern met America's rural past. <br></p><p>Robert Long is the editor of <i>Long Island Poets</i> and a contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>The Partisan Review</i>, among other publications. He lives in East Hampton, New York.<br>De Kooning's Bicycle<br>ONEOn maps, Long Island resembles a whale that's swum across the Atlantic Ocean southwest from Ireland, grazing Nantucket Island and Martha's Vineyard and slamming its big blunt head against the island of Manhattan, nudging it that much closer to the mainland at Jersey City.This whale stretches northeast for 120 miles. Its corroded flukes, known as the East End, split into North and South Forks and trail off into the ocean, the former running parallel with the south shore of Connecticut, which lies across Long Island Sound, the latter with a series of bays to the north and the ocean to the south.No matter where you go on the South Fork, water is nearby. It plays tricks with the light, which seems both clear and soft. It permeates the woods and the potato fields, and you sense it as you walk the streets of the villages. More successfully than most painters, William Merritt Chase and Willem de Kooning caught something of its pastel evanescence; it is the primary subject of everything that came from de Kooning's brush from the mid-1960s on, informing figures as well as landscape.The light may be the South Fork's principal aesthetic asset, but it is not the reason the area was settled in the mid-seventeenth century. People went there because they felt crowded, in any numberof ways, at home. And there was real estate to be had, and money to be made. They go there for the same reasons today, and because it is close to New York City, and because rich and famous people go there, as they did in the nineteenth century.The men and women who sailed to Southampton and East Hampton were part of the Puritan migration that had been making its way to the Eastern Seaboard since the settlement of Plymouth in 1620 and the signing of the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter in 1629. In 1640, the Long Parliament promised tolerance of Puritans in their homeland, but by then it was too late, for over twenty-one thousand people had fled the Old World for New England.The separation of church and state that had been lacking in England was lacking on the East End, too, but no one minded, because it was the Presbyterian Church, not the Church of England, that collected taxes from the townspeople for the next two centuries: "Everyone into the melting pot, just come out Presbyterian," as the urban historian and architect Robert A. M. Stern put it.Upon arriving in the colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut, many of these immigrants found that the place didn't exactly live up to its advance billing. Land was not as plentiful as advertised, and the soil was hardscrabble. So they made their way south, where the land was for the taking and the soil not as rocky.With the Indians out of the way (they had been further quieted with liquor and laudanum), the East Enders set up shop. Most had come from the English countryside, and so reestablished themselves in agriculture. The men raised sheep and geese, planted, hunted, and fished. The women sewed, knit, quilted, gardened, spun, and churned. They cooked wild birds, venison, fish, and samp, a cornmeal porridge whose recipe the Indianstaught them. They built cedar- and cypress-shingled houses whose roofs sloped from two stories at the back to one at the front, a configuration that allowed them to avoid a tax on two-story structures imposed by the King.The settlement was begun in a communal spirit, but a pecking order was soon established. Lion Gardiner came to America in the service of the King, who hoped to prevent the Dutch from claiming the territory, but he was a businessman, the seventeenth century's equivalent of a real estate speculator. Walt Whitman admired him, or the idea of him. "Tradition relates that Wyandance, the great chief of eastern Long Island, loved and obeyed Mr. Gardiner in a remarkable manner," he wrote. Having once sailed past it, Whitman conjured Gardiners Island as a kind of colonial Santa's Workshop:Imagine the Arcadian simplicity and plenty of the situation, and of those times. Doubtless, among his work-people, Mr. Gardiner had Indians, both men and women. Imagine the picturesqueness of the groups, at night in the large hall, or the kitchen--the mighty fire, the supper, the dignity and yet good humor of the heads of family, and the stalwart health of the brown-faced crowd around them. Imagine their simple pleasures, their interests, their occupations--how different from ours!&nbsp;<br>Well, yes and no.Wealth came to the settlers in a way that must have seemed like a biblical plague. One day, someone noticed that the fifty-foot-long, seventy-five-ton, glistening, reeking black carcass of a whale had washed up on the shore from the ocean. The creaturemay have been sick; it may have been disoriented or driven inland by an offshore storm. Such landings were common throughout the 1720s.The story of whaling on the East End is in outline the same as that found everywhere they have been hunted. At first, whales were abundant, washing up onshore or spotted close to land. A handful of men in a small boat set out in pursuit, and when the carcass was dragged ashore, it was divided among the townspeople. As the creatures decreased in number, it became necessary to sail farther from land to capture them. Eventually, they were sought on voyages of months or even years. Finally the expense of the ventures exceeded the revenue they yielded, and the industry collapsed.The Indians had been observed pursuing and killing whales as early as 1620. They cut up and cooked the blubber, using the rendered oil to preserve animal hides. The settlers realized that whales were valuable in manifold ways. Their oil was the most efficient fuel for illumination available, and everything from buggy whips and candles to corsets and collar stays could be fashioned from their bones and baleen. The economies of Southampton and East Hampton thereby flourished in a way no one had anticipated.The disposal of whales was at first a communal effort. Because time was of the essence whales rot quickly--everyone was expected to lend a hand in the unpleasant business of hacking up the smelly carcasses and cooking down the blubber. Children were even let out of school. Anyone who did not participate could be fined.The East Enders made the process as efficient as they could. Whaleboats patrolled the coast for weeks at a time. Onshore, a paid whale watcher alerted the town when he spotted a glossy black back breaking the ocean's skin. A crew of six--four rowers,a tiller, and a harpooner--piled into a twenty-foot cedar whaleboat, patterned after the Indians' dugout canoe. They chased down the creature, hoping to puncture its heart or lung. If the wound was made accurately, the whale could be towed to shore; if not, the whale dragged the men behind it for hours, until it tired, all the while snapping the boat in its wake like the tail of a kite.By the mid-1660s whaling had evolved into the private enterprise of a few fortunate families. It took capital to purchase a whaleboat, harpoons, the expensive iron kettle used to boil blubber, and special barrels for whale oil, and it was an investment most families could not afford to make. The Montaukett Indians, whose bartering arrangements with the settlers left them permanently in debt, entered into contracts in which they agreed to work for the whaling companies to settle those debts; in this way, they were bound to the English from year to year with little hope of paying all that they owed. The early whaling companies paid their employees with small amounts of cash and with whale bounty: the Indians were given fins, and the English received three-foot hunks of meat.The industry thus hastened the stratification of white society on the East End. And in a community that numbered about five hundred, resentments flourished, and were often played out in court, for the settlers and their early descendants were a litigious lot. Complaints were routinely filed over trivial matters, the most popular being slander and defamation of character.By 1700 Amagansett had become the main source for whale oil and whalebone on the Eastern Seaboard. A thriving market economy was now in place on the East End; social classes had been established. It was almost impossible to buy land unless you were descended from one of the settling families or extremely wealthy.And then the whales simply stopped coming. It would be years before the hunt for them resumed, this time in three-masted ships out of Sag Harbor. In the meantime, the East End lost its position on the front line of the economy, a victim of what later centuries would call overfishing. There was little reason for East Enders to maintain more than a tenuous connection with the rest of the world, and they reverted to obscurity.The families who had managed to get in on the whaling boom retained an aura of importance; they owned the most valuable land, in the hearts of the villages and along the ocean. Those who hadn't claimed a stake constituted the servant class and lived in outlying areas. The Long Island Rail Road tracks would come to mark the dividing line between the classes, then the Montauk Highway, when it became the more popular travel route; "south of the highway" still means class on the East End.As late as 1878, a visitor would describe East Hampton thus: "It is 5 miles from Sag Harbor, 15 from Greenport, and about 100 miles from New York. But from the way they are behind the times, should think they were about 5,000." Sag Harbor, however, had vitality; it was one of the most important whaling ports on the East Coast from the time of the Revolutionary War until 1857, when a financial crash killed off the industry for the second time. In any case, the discovery of petroleum a few years earlier meant that whale oil and spermaceti would soon be replaced by kerosene and paraffin.The most notable cultural presence on the East End until the end of the nineteenth century was that of a woodworking family, the Dominys. They were East Hampton farmers who in the off-seasons made about one thousand pieces of furniture over sixty-five years, handing down the craft through several generations. Nathaniel Dominy IV and his son and grandson ignored changing fashions and technological advances, but each added aspecialty to the family's arsenal, and they had a wide range of clients among the wealthier citizens of the East End. By the mid-nineteenth century the demand for their custom-made chairs, tables, desks, and bureaus had fallen as large companies began providing cheap, well-made furniture. But the Dominys had something else to offer, though it didn't fatten their purses. When hordes of painters descended upon East Hampton in the 1880s, the Dominy farmhouse, sagging with age, and its adjoining workshop became a popular subject. Nathaniel Dominy VII sometimes stepped outside to watch the artists work at their easels. "You fellows get a thousand dollars in York for a picture of my back door," he'd say, "and I get nothing."&nbsp;<br>Lange Eylandt, as the Dutch labeled it on maps, is sediment left by a glacier that plowed south as it melted for thousands of years, part of its detritus the South Fork, a hilly, scrubby ridge that slopes off to bays on the north, the ocean on the south. Like bubbles in pancake batter, pockets formed in the glacial sediment, kettle holes that held meltwater in the form of bays, ponds, harbors, and creeks.Because the Dutch wanted eastern Long Island, Lion Gardiner was sent there in the early 1630s to keep them from having it. He did so by building and commanding a fort at the mouth of the Connecticut River, north of Long Island. The fort also was meant to subdue the Pequot Indians, who had their own plans for the East End. In 1637, the nation was all but wiped out when Gardiner's men set fire to the Indian fort. Those who fled the inferno were shot or hacked up with swords.The Montaukett Indians, who had been paying protection money to the Pequots, began paying off the English instead. In a deal struck with Gardiner by Wyandance, the Montaukett chief,the English were granted exclusive trading rights with the tribe. With a continuous source of wampum, Gardiner could trade shells for whatever his heart desired, including beaver skins, which London merchants coveted. In this manner he acquired Gardiners Island, which he named the Isle of Wight on taking ownership of it in 1639. About a decade later, the English governors of the Connecticut and New Haven Colonies bought what is now East Hampton Town for a pile of looking glasses, hatchets, and knives, twenty coats, and a hundred muxes--the small metal drills used to string wampum on leather strips. Two years later they resold East Hampton to Gardiner for $30,000.At about the same time, the English acquired Southampton from the Shinnecocks in return for protecting them from the Narragansetts, and promptly segregated the Indians in Shinnecock Hills, where the golf club bearing their name, and designed by Stanford White, would be erected 250 years later.The Indians who sold the East End to the British thought they retained the right to hunt and fish where they liked, which was all they cared about. But the agreement was restrictive in a way that they could not have anticipated. Although an Indian was allowed to hunt "up and downe in the woods without Molestation," if he killed a deer, for example, he could keep the skin but was required to turn the body over to the English. The settlers shunted the Indians from one place to another, making it clear that they were not welcome in the village center unless on official business; those who did venture there were closely watched.By the mid-nineteenth century the Montauketts, whose population had been drastically reduced by smallpox and tuberculosis, were planted in an area just north of East Hampton Village called Freetown; the name can still be seen on maps. They sued to regain title to their former property in Montauk, but the suitwas dismissed in 1910, and an appeal was thrown out in 1918, when the court found that the Montauketts, by then even further diminished in number, no longer existed. A movement to reclaim the land in recent years has thus far failed to cohere.At the time Thomas Moran arrived in the late 1870s, East Hampton was a sleepy backwater whose charms were all but unknown to most New Yorkers; his presence there would help to draw attention to the area. Coinciding with his arrival was a vogue for plein-air painting, and the East End offered a limitless choice of subjects for painters who found inspiration in direct observation of nature.&nbsp;<br>Moran was the first significant artist to call the East End home and to memorably translate its late-nineteenth-century landscape into oil paint and scratches on a copper plate. An English-born traditionalist who was admired and encouraged by a fellow Lancashireman, John Ruskin, he rejected Impressionism as a distortion of God's handiwork. At his best, Moran was a relaxed literalist, and his pictures of East Hampton are his plainest and most affecting; they do not suffer, as his more famous paintings of Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon sometimes do, from the tendency to overstatement that Ruskin chided him for.Moran's friends who had sailed the south coast of Long Island told him that it was a paradise for painters, as full of subjects as any place he'd been, including Europe. So why look to the West, or to the Continent, when such material was close at hand? European artists saw plenty to paint in their own backyards; why couldn't Americans?&lt;...</p><h2>Air Gear, Vol. 2</h2><p>GIRL TROUBLE!<br><br>When his new Air Treck skates need maintenance, Itsuki Minami takes them to a local sports shop, where he finally meets Simca Noyamano, the mysterious and very sexy girl he&#x2019;s had his eye on.

I gotta be a part of this!"<br><br>In his first picture book, comedian and bestselling author Jerry Seinfeld takes readers on a wild ride through his hilarious vision of Halloween. From Superman costumes that look like pajamas to the agony of getting bad trick-or-treat candy, Seinfeld's tale resonates with vivid experiences of a day every kid loves.<br><br> Collector's Edition with CD.</p><p>If the only "really clear thought" you had as a kid was "Get candy," you'll be at one with comedian Jerry Seinfeld's first children's picture book, <i>Halloween</i>. This nostalgic view of Halloweens past will ring true with everyone who remembers the trials and tribulations of trick-or-treating--from the stupid masks with thin gray rubber straps and cheap little staples to the humiliation of having to wear a winter coat over your store-bought Superman costume. Of course, the smart-alecky Seinfeld puts his own stamp on things in a voice that is so distinctly his: "Come on lady, let's go! Halloween, doorbells, candy, let's pick it up in there." He wants "name candy" only, make no mistake, and even trick-or-treats with an organizational cabinet on wheels, with drawers labeled "Crunchy Things," "Sour Things," "Rejects," etc. James Bennett's exaggerated, hilarious, expressive illustrations of the young Jerry (yes, it looks <i>exactly</i> like him) suit the over-the-top story to a T. Unusual child's-eye perspectives on parents (and friends up the sidewalk who won't wait up) add energy to a book that is already sugar-charged. Like Jerry's standup routines, <i>Halloween</i> focuses on the minutiae and will make you laugh even if you try to resist.

Gardner was a civil rights lawyer before becoming an author and as a result his plots contain intricate, twisting plots. These are whodunits in the very best tradition. In a career that spanned five decades, Gardner wrote 146 books, 85 of which feature the famous lawyer Perry Mason. The fictional attorney became the basis of a popular TV series, achieving an enviable record for winning his cases.

Yet despite dazzling success with the public, it never received its fair share of praise from the critics. Gene Kelly's genius as a performer is there for all to see. What is less acknowledged is his innovatory contribution as director. Peter Wollen has finally done justice to this landmark film. In a brilliant shot-by-shot analysis of the famous title number, illustrated by specially produced frame stills, he shows how skillfully Kelly binds the dance and musical elements into the narrative, and how he successfully combines two distinctive traditions within American Dance, tap and ballet.<br> Scriptwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and indeed Kelly himself, were all under threat from the McCarthyism which menaced Hollywood at this time. The ethos in which the film was conceived could not long survive in the era of blacklisting. Wollen argues convincingly that <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> was the high point in the careers of those who worked on it.</p><p>Peter Wollen's remarkable treatment of <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> approaches the film from many different angles. Wollen sees the movie as an important contribution to the history of modern dance, a representative example of the 1950s musical, a significant comment on American McCarthyist policies, and a work that is at once a collaborative effort and the product of Gene Kelly's creative genius. As Wollen develops these points, he also provides a shot-by-shot analysis of Kelly's <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> number, perhaps the most famous dance sequence in any movie musical. Wollen concludes his revelatory book by talking about <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> as part of American mythmaking. He also provides an excellent annotated bibliography that will lead you to further reading on the filmmakers, the genre of the musical, and even the rudiments of tap dancing!Peter Wollen teaches film at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The air around him crackled when he raised his head and glared at her. He'd been bred, born, and raised for that night and she didn't have a chance against his wiles. He was bigger than she was and he knew it. He was meaner and he'd prove it.</p> <p>Gemma O'Donnell didn't give a damn how big or how mean he was. She intended to be in control from the minute she mounted him. The message from the set of his head and unwavering stare said that she was an idiot not to shake in her cowgirl boots. She glared right back, her dark green eyes meeting his near black ones and locking through the metal bars separating them.</p> <p>He dared.</p> <p>She challenged.</p> <p>She hiked a leg up to the first rung on the chute, and two hands circled her waist from behind to help her. Her heart slipped in an extra beat at the cowboy's big hands touching her, but she attributed it to nerves. She glanced over her shoulder into the sexiest brown eyes she'd ever seen, all dreamy and soft with heavy dark lashes.</p> <p>"Thanks," she said.</p> <p>"My pleasure. Go get 'em, darlin'." His voice went with the rest of the package: a deep Texas drawl that sounded like it should have been singing country songs in Nashville, not riding wild broncs on the PRCA Million Dollar Rodeo Tour.</p> <p>Dammit, Trace Coleman. You pulled a slick one, but it's not going to work. You are not going to throw me off my game, she thought as she slung a leg over the top and locked eyes with the wild creature again. She had a horse to ride and even though his coat was as white as the driven snow, the look in his black eyes said that he could run Lucifer some serious competition when it came to meanness.</p> <p>His name was Smokin' Joe and he was a rodeo legend. Cowboys said that he could see right into the soul of a rider and could feel the fear he'd struck in their hearts. Well, Gemma wasn't afraid of Smokin'-damn-Joe. He wasn't a bit meaner than the bronc out on Rye's ranch that she'd trained on, and she'd shown him who was boss. Smokin' Joe was just the next bronc in a long line, so he could take his evil glare and suck it up. Tonight she was the boss. She didn't care if the other riders had made bets about how quickly into the ride he'd throw her off into the dust. She'd show them all, cowboys and bronc alike, that a cowgirl had come to town.</p> <p>She had two options.</p> <p>Number one: Stay on his back for eight seconds and show him she was the boss.</p> <p>Number two: Wreck.</p> <p>There was no in between, and "almost" did not count. Gemma didn't allow herself to think the word wreck, not even when the almighty Trace Coleman produced a smile that would part the clouds. He was well over six feet tall, with dark hair and light brown eyes. She'd done her homework on all the cowboys. She knew most of them personally from the rodeo rounds, but she'd only known Trace by picture and reputation. Both of which intrigued her to no end. When she'd seen him in action in San Antonio, the heat level of the whole great state of Texas jacked up twenty more degrees. His swagger, his broad chest, and his body had said that Gemma was in deep trouble. But it was that deep sexy Texas drawl that brought on images of tangled sheets, lots and lots of heat, and a warm oozy feeling called an afterglow flitting through her mind.</p> <p>Trace might have just meant to be charming and helpful, holding his hand out to assist her in climbing the chute, but Gemma wasn't buying his brand of bullshit. He wasn't stupid, and the twinkle in his eye said he knew exactly how his touch affected a woman. Besides, his gaggle of rodeo groupies were proof positive of that. In San Antonio, Austin, Redding, and Reno, Gemma had seen them circling him like a chocolate addict set loose with free rein in a candy store. Oh, yes, without a single doubt Trace knew how to turn a woman's mind to mush, and she'd lay dollars to horse apples that he played it to the nth degree.</p> <p>Just like Smokin' Joe, Trace Coleman had met his match. Gemma intended to win that big shiny belt buckle in Las Vegas come December and leave Trace Coleman along with his scanty-dressed groupies in a cloud of dust. She had a big construction-paper lucky horseshoe tacked to the door of her travel trailer, and every time she won, she rewarded herself by pasting a small shamrock on it. After the final ride, it would be matted and framed and hung in her beauty shop, and all the cowboys who'd given her a hard time could crawl up under a mesquite bush and lick their wounds.</p> <p>Any other time and any other place she might have flirted with Trace. Cowboys were definitely her thing, and he sent out vibes that dug deep into her gut. But this was the rodeo circuit. For the next six months, Gemma O'Donnell had her job cut out for her and there was no room for Trace or any other cowboy.</p> <p>Damn his sorry old hide, anyway! He was the top-seeded contestant in the tour and ten thousand dollars ahead of her. Staying on Smokin' Joe's back a full eight seconds could knock Trace off that pedestal in a tailspin-if thinking about his dreamy eyes didn't ruin her score. She took a deep breath and put him out of her mind. If he thought his cute little grin and deep voice could mess her up, then he could smear ketchup on his chaps and eat them for supper. And slap a little taco sauce on his spurs and have them for dessert.</p> <p>She closed her eyes.</p> <p>He will not bother me. He will not get into my head. He will not throw me off my game.</p> <p>She kept the three sentences running on a continuous loop as she slung a leg over the top of the chute and got ready to mount old Smokin' Joe. She couldn't very well ride with her eyes shut, so she opened them, only to see Trace standing beside the bucking chute with a cocky little grin on his face. Light-brown chaps parenthesized a package locked behind his zipper that looked so inviting that Gemma almost drooled. She envisioned peeling his tight jeans from his body, leaving him wearing only boots, that cute grin, and a Stetson that sat just right.</p> <p>"God Almighty," she whispered.</p> <p>Someone called his name and he turned and walked away. But the backside was just as hot as the front with his chaps framing the cutest butt she'd ever seen. Lord, if she could stay on the horse eight seconds it would be a miracle. If she got a score high enough to beat him, it would be pure damn magic. She blinked and imagined Trace tossing his hat toward a pitchfork in a hayloft and coming toward her with those brown eyes speaking volumes about how hot that hayloft was about to get.</p> <p>Stop it this minute! You've got to stay on this horse eight seconds. Sweet Jesus, you haven't ever let a man upset you with just a touch before. What in the hell is the matter with you? Get it together, Gemma O'Donnell!</p> <p>The familiar whoosh filled her ears. When she had first started riding, her brothers had told her to focus on the ride and block everything else out. She'd imagined holding a conch shell up to her ear. Nothing could break through her concentration once she got her whoosh mojo going. And she was almost in the zone.</p> <p>Folks around Cody, Wyoming, were big rodeo fans, so the stands were packed with a loud, rowdy crowd that night. But Gemma didn't look up into the crowd, even though a rider likes a whole arena full of noisy fans as much as a country music band likes to play to a lively audience. If she looked, it would break her focus, and she'd already drawn the meanest damn horse in the rodeo. Which was good because if he bucked hard that meant more points. She rolled her neck, limbering it up for the ride and reminding herself to keep it loose. It only took one drop of fear to lock it in place and then boom, whiplash would put her out of the next ride over in St. Paul, Oregon.</p> <p>The announcer's voice was full of excitement. "Gemma O'Donnell, our only woman contestant in saddle bronc riding, will be coming out of gate six. Gemma comes to us from Ringgold, Texas, and I hear she can ride anything with four legs. She told me this afternoon that her big regret in life is not pursuing this dream before now and letting Kaila Mussell take home bragging rights to being the first woman to show the boys how it's done. Keep your eyes on gate six and let's make some noise for Gemma, who intends to be the second woman ever to win the bronc riding contest when the dust settles in Las Vegas in December."</p> <p>When she settled back into the saddle, she was fully well in her riding zone. The announcer might as well have been reciting poetry, because all Gemma heard was each heartbeat in her ears as she eased into the saddle. She tried to psych Smokin' Joe out. It wasn't against the rules, and he'd done the same thing when he glared at her through the bars. She leaned forward and whispered softly in his ear, "You do your damnedest, old boy. Buck the hardest you've ever done and I'll do my damnedest to stay on your back. I need the scores, so give me your wildest ride. Don't you hold back a thing because I'm a woman, darlin'. I could ride you with my eyes shut and eating a hamburger with my free hand."</p> <p>She measured the hot pink and black rein and got a death grip on it. Her saddle had been tweaked by her brother Dewar and the rein braided by her brother Rye. The gold lucky horseshoe pin had been fastened to her hot pink hat by her brother Raylen. All of it was important but especially the saddle. To a bronc rider, a saddle or stirrups can be off one-quarter of an inch and it might as well be a mile. It has to be absolutely perfect, in tune with the rider and so comfortable that she could sleep in it.</p> <p>She shoved the heels of her boots firmly down into the stirrups and put everything out of her mind but the "mark out." The heels of her boots had to be above the points of Smokin' Joe's shoulders before the horse's front legs hit the ground. After that it would be an eight-second line dance. Smokin' Joe would buck. Gemma's legs would go back and come forward, spurring him on to buck even more. In the end one of them would win, and Gemma was absolutely determined that Smokin' Joe would lose.</p> <p>If she missed the mark out she'd be disqualified, so she got ready.</p> <p>Rein in hand.</p> <p>Determination in her heart.</p> <p>"Eight seconds!" Trace's deep voice said from the top of the chute.</p> <p>She could have shot him, dragged his sorry carcass out to the back side of the O'Donnell ranch, and poured barbecue sauce on him for the coyotes. She vowed that she would get even. He had the next ride of the evening and paybacks were a bitch. He should have thought of that before he broke her concentration.</p> <p>She pulled up on the multicolored rein.</p> <p>Everything stopped and she was in a vacuum. Even the dust out in the arena was afraid to succumb to gravity and fall back to earth. The noise of the crowd hung above the arena like a layer of foggy smoke in a cheap honky-tonk, but Gemma couldn't hear it.</p> <p>She settled her straw hat with the lucky gold horseshoe pin attached to the brim on the back of her head, touched the horseshoe for good luck, and nodded. Three rodeo clowns stepped away from the gate. The chute opened and a blur of white topped with snatches of hot pink whirled around the arena, kicking up dust devils in its wake.</p> <p>Time moved in slow motion. She could hear the crowd going wild and the announcer's excitement, but the roar of blood racing through her veins kept all of it at bay. The dry dirt clouds filling her nostrils were like drugs to an addict, and with every breath she took in more, the exhilaration so great that her heart was on the brink of explosion. The horse attempted to twist itself into a pretzel, but her body responded with the right movements instinctively. The next move put both his back legs into the air and she felt like she was on a little kid's slide. The dirt arena came up to meet her and then boom, Smokin' Joe was a damn camel with a big hump where his back used to be. But she stayed loose in the saddle, moving her legs the right way for balance as if she'd been born to ride Smokin' Joe that day in Cody, Wyoming.</p> <p>She didn't hear the buzzer saying that she'd stayed with the ride until the end. When one of the three pickup riders reached out and looped an arm around her, she hung on to the reins until he yelled and then she let go. She slid off the bucking bronc's back and let the rider carry her to safety in the middle of the arena.</p> <p>"And that's how it's done, cowgirls and cowboys!" the announcer screamed into the microphone. "With that kind of competition, Trace Coleman had better be ready to ride like the wind. Let's hear it for Gemma O'Donnell, a small-town Texas girl who just showed the legendary Smokin' Joe who is the boss. And the judges are tallying the scores. While they get the final number, give it up one more time for Gemma O'Donnell."</p> <p>She inhaled and waited.</p> <p>High seventies would be wonderful. Anything more would be icing on the cake. She'd gotten a seventy-eight in Reno, Nevada, two weeks before, but Trace had walked away with a seventy-nine. He hadn't ridden yet in Cody, and she had no doubts that the number one pick for this year's bronc rider would score high.</p> <p>"Eighty for the lady! Put 'em together, fans, for the little lady from Ringgold, Texas. Next up, the man of the hour, Mr. Trace Coleman, is climbing into the bucking chute behind gate eight. Will Gemma give him a run for his money today, or will he take home the purse and the bragging rights as first place in the bronc busters for a while longer? We'll see here in a few minutes when he comes out of the gate."</p> <p>Gemma exhaled loudly. She rushed to gate eight and climbed up the side right beside two cowboys. Trace had settled into the saddle and had his own special red, white, and blue rein in his hands.</p> <p>He looked up, said, "I'll show you how it's done, darlin'," and winked. He touched a gold hat pin that looked like a miniature ranch brand from where she stood.</p> <p>So he was superstitious too, was he? Did he eat the same thing for supper every night of a ride? Did he wear the same socks and boots to every rodeo, no matter if the socks had holes and the boots were scuffed?</p> <p>Luck be damned. Payback time had arrived.</p> <p>She blew him a kiss. All was fair in love, war, and bronc riding. It was probably even written in the fine print at the back of the rule book.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, he caught the imaginary kiss midair and stuffed it inside his black vest pocket.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trace had known he'd met his match the first time he saw Gemma O'Donnell. Her name had come up in rodeo conversations for a couple of years, but he'd never ridden against her or even in the same rodeos as she had. Not until she showed up in Rapid City, South Dakota, four months before. She'd flown in and rode one mean bronc that night, had a big wreck about three seconds into the ride, and was gone the next day. He didn't do much better at that rodeo. He lost control five seconds after he came out of the chute and Dugger McDonald from Cheyenne, Wyoming, took the purse home.</p> <p>But that Irish beauty had haunted his dreams for the past four months. He'd watched her determination and her form, but he'd also seen her walk away when she'd been defeated, head held high and back ramrod straight, no tears for th...</p></p><h2>A Kick in the Head: An Everyday Guide to Poetic Forms</h2><p><b>From the simplest couplet to the mind-boggling pantoum, the award-winning team behind&nbsp;<i>A Poke in the I&nbsp;</i>shows us the many fascinating ways poetic forms take shape.</b><br><br>Please<br>Open this book for something<br>Extraordinary.<br>Twenty-nine different poetic forms await you<br>Inside these pages.

When they steal a station wagon for the journey, the brothers accidentally kidnap Martha Zacharias, a Mennonite girl asleep in the back of the car. Martha turns out to be a stubborn survivor who refuses to be sent home, so together these unlikely road companions attempt to escape across the Mexican border, pursued by the police and Martha&#x2019;s vengeful father.<br> <br> The story is told partly through Troy&#x2019;s journal, in which he chronicles his encounters with con artists, down-and-outers, and roadside philosophers, people looking for fast money, human connection, or a home long since vanished.

Captain Slaughterboard is the most ferocious and wicked pirate you could ever imagine. He likes nothing better than cutting people up with his cutlass or making them walk the plank. Then one day, on a remote island, he spies a strange Yellow Creature - and from that time on, he&#39;s a changed man. How he loves the Yellow Creature! They become the best of friends, always together, sailing the oceans. But will Captain Slaughterboard ever drop anchor for good? This book is from the cult novelist Mervyn Peake, with a new introduction by his son, Fabian.</p><p>Back in the 1930s, a young man named Mervyn Peake fled the pressures of modern society for the Channel Islands in hopes of living a free, bohemian life with his wife and two sons. Each Sunday, he would draw pictures of pirates, comical animals, and shipboard scenarios for his family's amusement. <i>Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor</i>, first published in 1939, is a stunning collection of those marvelously detailed illustrations and a splendid, swashbuckling story to boot. As the salty sea captain's name might suggest, he is as bloodthirsty a pirate as they come. One day, blue-tattooed mate Charlie Choke spies a pink island on the horizon. "'Pink!' shouted the Captain, leaping to his feet. 'That's just the sort I like. Sail me there and hurry up or I'll chop you all up into mincemeat.'"<p> On the island, they capture the gentle Yellow Creature (much to its glee) and bring it back to their boat. The other island inhabitants, all purple, silently watch the Y.C. leave, except for the bottom-dwelling Plummet who "couldn't <i>see</i> that anything was happening, but he <i>felt</i> it was." Suffice it to say that this nonsensical Lewis Carrollific, Edward Learesque story is a pure delight. Peake's imaginative, R. Crumb-style illustrations of pirate life and fanciful creatures are rich with detail that children will love examining at length. To top it all off, he offers a story of unlikely friendship of a ferocious pirate who comes to wonder how he could have ever enjoyed battle so much and the Yellow Creature, who is an expert at lounging around and eating fruit. Eccentric, playful, and as utterly original as all of Mervyn Peake's work (The Ghormenghast trilogy), <i>Captain Slaughterboard</i> is a classic that well deserves this no-less-than-fantastic recasting.

Animals are her subject, one she takes seriously enough to inform readers of Latin nomenclature and unusual trivia. Data aside, the creatures captured in two dimensions are both common (butterflies) and extraordinary (carpet python); and all necessary stitching information is included. The major distinguishing aspect of her presentation is that needlework formats need be neither staid nor confined to one object; her designs cover both footstools and flooring with equal ease. Materials and conversion charts appended. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i>The most notable feature of this book is the presentation of native animals in a large pictorial atlas of the world that is worked entirely in cross-stitch on interlock canvas. Individual animals can also be worked separately, in ecological groupings of plants and animals or as letters in a pictorial alphabet. The animal designs are large, colorful, and very realistic.

In the American tradition of historical narratives, this book traces the lives of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison with emphasis on their religious views and personal expressions of faith. They held strong religious beliefs as evidenced by their personal papers found in the Library of Congress, National Archives, and other libraries. These documents prove that the early American founders were united on six major issues: 1. Freedom of Religion is a fundamental right. 2. No one, especially government officials, should interfere with the free exercise of religion. 3. There should not be one official religion of the United States. 4. Federal tax dollars should not be allocated to favored churches and religious groups. 5. Different religions from around the world should be respected. 6. The separation of Church &amp; State should be maintained. <br><br>This book documents the origins of religious freedom in America, a topic of importance to people around the world.</p><p>The product of twenty years of careful research in the National Archives, Library of Congress, and other libraries, this book presents views on a national theme, "Religion and the State." The ideas of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison on Church-State issues, as well as their personal religious views, reflect the roots of religion in America. The Founders&#x2019; ideas on the "free exercise of religion" illuminate their original intent regarding our First Amendment rights. <p>Dr. Franklin recommended public prayer at the Constitutional Convention. Jefferson recommended to children that they read the Bible. Madison felt strongly that government officials should not interfere with our private lives. While respecting the value of religion, they supported separation of Church and State. </p><p>Church-State issues remain hotly debated. The national media regularly covers related topics: "Faith-based Initiatives," "Prayer in Schools," "In God We Trust," "Public Displays of Ten Commandments," and more. </p><p>Because Franklin, Jefferson, and Madison played such key roles in the creation of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights, their writings are especially important. When they speak to the "original intent" of the founders, their documents provide direct evidence for interpreting our Constitutional rights. This is the kind of evidence sometimes considered by Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to determine the "original intent" of the Constitution. </p><p>Religious freedom is important to people around the world. However, not everyone enjoys the same protections offered under the U.S. Constitution. This book may be especially meaningful to people still striving to achieve freedom of religion. For those struggling under religious persecution, we hope the visions of Franklin, Jefferson, and Madison will inspire courage and self-determination.</p>Gregory Schaaf is a specialist on the history of U.S. Constitutional Law.

Born Leroi Jones in 1934--he became Amiri Baraka in the mid-1960s---he is one of the seminal figures of contemporary black writing, a poet, playwright, novelist, critic, and political activist. Even more than those labels indicate, however, Baraka has been at the heart of literary and ideological ferment since the 1950s. Early in his career, he was strongly influenced by the Beats. During the cultural upheaval of the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s, he moved uptown to Harlem, changed his name, and embraced a religion that was a hybrid of Islam and traditional African principles. And then, in the 1970s, Baraka turned his back on Black Nationalism and embraced Marxist Leninism. The autobiography, written in Baraka's inimitable style, one that we might call word-jazz, ends there.Poet, dramatist, novelist, critic, teacher, and political activist Amiri Baraka, born LeRoi Jones, vividly recounts his crusading role in African-American literature. A driving force behind the Black Arts Movement, the prolific Baraka retells his experiences from his participation in avant-garde literature after World War II and his role in Black nationalism after the assassination of Malcolm X to his conversion to Islam and his commitment to an international socialist vision. When The Autobiography of LeRoi Jones was first published in 1984, the publisher made substantial cuts in the copy. Under the careful direction of the author, the book has been restored to its original form. This is the first complete and unexpurgated version of Baraka&#39;s life and work.</p><h2>Ewha Korean. 1-1 (in English) (Korean edition)</h2><p>[ About Ewha Korean] Ewha Korean is a series of textbooks and workbooks, comprising 26 volumes from level 1 through level 6, for students learning Korean as a foreign language.

Pr.). His latest work is the first genuine biography of Pericles in English since A.R. Burn's Pericles and Athens (1949) and the most spirited defense of the Athenian democracy since W.G. Forrest's The Emergence of Greek Democracy (1966). The book is a lively and thoughtful chronicle of the years leading up to and into the great war between the Athenians and Spartans. Pericles is cast as the tragic hero whose flaw is the very rationality with which he so skillfully guided the Athenians and forged an empire. Contrary to the charges of both ancient and modern critics, Kagan argues that the democracy was a rational, deliberate, and moderate regime, and Pericles is portrayed as the consummate visionary political leader whose great mistake was to expect everyone to think and behave as rationally as he did. This learned and passionate book is sure to cause controversy and is recommended to both academic and public libraries.<br><i>- V.

Four ways to serve their country. Morris, Rudi, Ivan, and Beck are best friends for life. So when one of the teens is drafted into the Vietnam War, the others sign up, too.

Haunted by dreams of violence and death, Morris makes it his personal mission to watch over his friends &#x2014; and the best place to do that is in the US Navy. Stationed off the coast of Vietnam on the USS Boston, Morris and his fellow sailors provide crucial support to the troops on the ground. But the Boston itself isn't safe from attack.

From its early, informal days as a gentlemen&#39;s competition to its later role as an integral part of organized college athletics, Thomas C. Mendenhall traces the history of The Race through its formative period. The recognized authority on the history of collegiate rowing, Mendenhall covers the personalities, the technical and stylistic controversies, and the grand spectacle of the races themselves in graceful prose heavily illustrated with period images. This book will delight anyone interested in competitive rowing or collegiate athletics.</p><p></p><h2>The Baltic: A New History of the Region and its People</h2><p>A history of the Baltic region includes coverage of some of the European community&#39;s newest member states and economies, reporting on such topics as the area&#39;s early Viking days, its roles in multiple military engagements, and its twenty-first century growth in spite of neo-imperialist pressure from post-Soviet Russia.</p><p>In this long-needed history of the peoples and nations surrounding the Baltic Sea, we pass through the legendary castles of Elsinore and Halsingborg to enter a unique landscape and culture. Alan Palmer traces the history of the Baltic region from its early Viking days and its time under the Byzantine Empire through its medieval prime when the Baltic Sea served as one of Europe's central trading grounds. Palmer addresses both the strong nationalist sentiments that have driven Baltic culture and the early attempts at Baltic unification by Sweden and Russia. The Baltic also dissects the politics and culture of the region in the twentieth century, when it played multiple historic roles: it was the Eastern Front in the First World War; the setting of early uprisings in the Russian Revolution; a land occupied by the Nazis during the Second World War; and, until very recently, a region dominated by the Soviets. <p>In the twenty-first century, increasing attention has been focused on the Baltic states as they grow into their own in spite of growing neo-imperialist pressure from post-Soviet Russia. In The Baltic, Alan Palmer provides readers with a detailed history of the nations and peoples that are now poised to emerge as some of Europe's most vital democracies.</p>Alan Palmer was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and is the author of The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire, The Dictionary of British Empire and Commonwealth, and Victory 1918.

She began writing on manners and protocol during her diplomatic service in 1949, and she has been hailed on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine as "America's leading arbiter of manners." Originally published in 1989, her <i>Complete Guide to New Manners</i> has now been thoroughly revised and updated to incorporate the changing social conventions and enormous technological advances of the past fifteen years. <br> Baldrige was the first etiquette writer to advise extensively on the subject of manners in the workplace. With her legendary background in both the government and business worlds, she remains the prime authority on the integration of goals that often seem at odds with one another -- namely, family, work, and pleasure. Baldrige provides fresh guidelines on etiquette at work and in every form of communication, from letters to emails to cell phone calls. <br> She also updates the way we approach the traditional rites of passage -- weddings, funerals, religious ceremonies, gatherings large and small. Here are authoritative answers to the etiquette questions and issues involved in nontraditional family relationships -- stepfamilies, adult children returning home, elderly parents moving in, gays and lesbians in the family, dating for the newly single, and the myriad complications that spring from divorce. <br> Through it all, Baldrige does not forget the essence of manners: they are an expression of love and care, and they are under our control. <i>New Manners for New Times</i> is a comprehensive encyclopedia that will lead readers confidently and correctly through the maze of lifestyles, customs, business, and ways of relating to others in this new, complex millennium. But it is, above all, a very personal statement.</p><p><b>Letitia Baldrige,</b> a world-famous expert on manners, has written nineteen books, including her bestselling <i>New Complete Guide to Executive Manners.</i> She served as social secretary at the U.S. embassies in Paris and Rome and was chief of staff for Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House. She has run her own company, Letitia Baldrige Enterprises, since 1964. Baldrige and her family live in Washington, D.C.Manners "give us... a feeling that if we do the right thing and avoid the wrong thing, everything will be all right." But, notes manners expert Baldrige, they can also help us attain happiness. That's right; knowing how much to tip a hotel maid can help you achieve internal bliss. Baldrige explains: "When you're nice to someone else... that someone else is nice back to you, and suddenly two people feel good about themselves and each other, and spread their feelings." A stretch, perhaps, but still, an admirable approach to manners. Baldrige differentiates between etiquette and manners (the former is a set of behavior rules; the latter teaches one how to value another's self-esteem), and illuminates both. She covers relationships, rites of passage, entertaining, gift giving, difficult times and communication. Although it's a bit overwhelming at first, the work is broken down into reasonable categories. And there's certainly something to be said for a book that can explain the difference between various caviar varieties, tell you how to write a thank-you note and suggest how to bring up the subject of condoms while on a date. Baldrige, ever hip to today's customs, addresses modern realities such as late marriages and e-mail, and can be quite funny (perhaps unintentionally, as when she lists "complete turnoff questions never to ask a single person," such as "bet you're desperate to get married, aren't you?"). Throughout, she keeps her focus on "real manners," for example, "[I]t's not worthwhile wondering who should go through the revolving door first, but it is worthwhile rushing to help an elderly or disabled stranger through the revolving door..--t's not worthwhile wondering who should go through the revolving door first, but it is worthwhile rushing to help an elderly or disabled stranger through the revolving door."<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pure Slaughter Value</h2><p>In his extraordinary debut collection, <i>Pure Slaughter Value,</i> Robert Bingham tracks the conscience of a generation that grew up educated, privileged, and starved for meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bingham's strange sense of morbid fancy collides with a gutsy realism; the result is splendid wreckage: a young man is seduced by his first cousin (or maybe it's the other way around) at her brother's wake ("The Other Family"); a bored couple plot to kill a man during their ski-resort honeymoon ("Marriage Is Murder"); a yuppie banker risks his whole perfect life for an affair with a junkie ("The Fixers"); an insurance-company bounty hunter tracks down walkaways from drug and alcohol rehab ("Preexisting Condition"); and in the title story, an eleven-year-old boy is caught at the exquisitely uneasy intersection of the safety of childhood play and the pain of grown-up love and longing.<br><br>These lean, potent stories are utterly original, and yet by turns recall Salinger, in their intellectual acuity, emotional depth, and wicked, dark humor; Fitzgerald, in their vivid chronicling of a new, restless social elite; and the work of "transgressive" writers, in their pervasive sense of the imminent possibility of danger and violence, even in the most civilized surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, the stories in <i>Pure Slaughter Value</i> mark the debut of a striking new literary voice--unsparing, bold, ironic, and true--that will haunt us for a long time to come.</p><p>"The new Lost Generation finds an accomplished mouthpiece in Bingham...an agile, savagely funny writer...it's fun to watch his brainy, abject characters tie themselves in knots." <i>--Publishers Weekly</i><p>"Robert Bingham writes like the bastard nephew of John Cheever. His masterfully crafted portraits of the American ruling class are at once casually intimate and coruscating. A spy in the dorm rooms and the boardrooms of privilege, he stalks where hacks have rushed in before him, and brings back stories we have never quite heard before--stories that are difficult to forget."<br>--Jay McInerney</p><p>"Robert Bingham's <i>Pure Slaughter Value</i> is a very fine thing--eerie and precise, deadpan but full of wicked subcurrents, sexual, psychological, and otherwise--a real marvel of wild, heavy thinking disguised as stories so quiet and even-keeled that you literally don't know what hit you."<br>--Dennis Cooper</p><p>"<i>Pure Slaughter Value</i> is a fine debut for a writer who is loaded with talent."<br>--Ward Just</p><p>"Like their author, these characters are ferociously wised up. Think of social, fiduciary, and erotic affiliations between the children of John Cheever's characters and Robert Stone's. Think of Tom and Daisy Buchanan's offspring, but with more than two wits to rub together. Why the long faces? Asked and answered by Bingham's drug- and booze-fuzzed (but agonizingly alert), precociously tapped-out protagonists. The narrators of the first-person tales are ferally unforgiving of themselves, feeling corruptions surging through their privileged genes like viral time-bombs. Bingham's voices--truly one collective voice, with relentless consistency of moral vision--are immediate: a Bingham character lives bang in this New York minute, morally vigilant, nobody's fool but his own fool. These stories hurt; they're meant to hurt, one hundred percent felt." <br>--Geoffrey Wolff</p><p>"You take some fascinatingly unlikable characters, mash them up with chillingly despicable ones, incorporate them in surprising and funny stories, and you get a convincing mlange called <i>Pure Slaughter Value</i> that you wish wasn't so convincing. You then try to comfort yourself with the thought that your creations remind you of no more than 50% of the people you know."<br>--Amanda Filipacchi</p><p>"[Bingham] writes with elegance and economy and a wicked sense of humor."<br><i>--Los Angeles Times</i></p><p></p><b>Robert Bingham</b> was the author of the highly praised short story collection&nbsp;<i>Pure Slaughter Value</i>.

Bursting with energy and filled with moments of absolute beauty, this bighearted and inspired novel ponders life&#x2019;s terrible surprises as well as its immeasurable rewards.</p></p><p><p><b> Amazon Exclusive: Essay by Jonathan Evison</b></p> <p>"Listen to me: everything you think you know, every relationship you&#x2019;ve ever taken for granted, every plan or possibility you&#x2019;ve ever hatched, every conceit or endeavor you&#x2019;ve ever concocted, can be stripped from you in an instant. Sooner or later, it will happen. So prepare yourself. Be ready not to be ready. Be ready to be brought to your knees and beaten to dust. Because no stable foundation, no act of will, no force of cautious habit will save you from this fact: nothing is indestructible."</p> <p>&#x2014; from <em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em></p> <p>The weekend of my sister&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday, she took a road trip with some friends down to Lucerne Valley in the Mojave Desert. For two weeks prior, the trip was a source of debate around our dinner table. My old man reasoned that since she was a responsible kid, got good grades, fed her pets, and honored her curfew, she ought to be allowed to take the trip. My mother reasoned that it was a bad idea. She didn&#x2019;t trust the other kids. They were a scraggly bunch.</p> <p>My sister took the trip. She never came home. She was killed in a freak car accident the weekend she turned sixteen years old. The incident, the specifics of which have never been explained satisfactorily by anyone, all but exploded my family. My parents divorced after twenty-five years of marriage. I lost what amounted to my primary caregiver. My oldest brother was deeply depressed for two years afterward and was really never the same in some fundamental way. To this day, my family is still feeling the shockwaves. I&#x2019;m still walking around with this sister-shaped hole in my heart. After a few beers, my brother will still lament the fact that he owed her seven bucks at the time of the accident. The seven bucks had been a point of contention involving the sale of a ten-speed bike. They argued fiercely about the money up until the day she left. At fifty-seven, my brother is still trying to pay that debt.</p> <p>There are holes in our lives that can never be filled--not really, not ever. And yet, we have no choice but to try to fill them. We must drive on in the face of debilitating loss, crippling guilt, overwhelming hopelessness. Because to give up is to be dead. I&#x2019;ve lived with this idea since I was five years old.</p> <p>Ben Benjamin is a character who has lost virtually everything--his wife, his family, his home, his livelihood. Broken, stripped down, stricken, and without hope, Ben is a shadow of his old self. He has been a stay-at-home dad for nearly a decade, so the job market has all but passed him by. With few options, Ben registers for a twenty-eight-hour night class called The Fundamentals of Caregiving, where, in the sweltering basement of the Abundant Life Foursquare Church, Ben learns how to insert catheters and avoid liability. He learns about professionalism and how to erect and maintain certain boundaries, how to keep physical and emotional distance between the client and the care provider. He learns that caregiving is just a job. But when Ben finds himself assigned to a tyrannical nineteen-year-old named Trev, who is in the advanced stages of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, he discovers that the endless mnemonics and service plan checklists presented in his class have done little to prepare him for the reality of caring for a fiercely stubborn, scared, sexually frustrated adolescent with an ax to grind with the world at large.</p> <p>When I set out to write this novel, I didn&#x2019;t envision it as a road novel. I&#x2019;ve never had a desire to write a road novel--in fact, I was very resistant to the idea. But the characters led me to the road. They left me no choice. They all but dragged me kicking and screaming to the road. It seemed Ben and Trev were always driving around in that van of Trev&#x2019;s, but they were never getting anywhere. They were both stuck. They needed that van to deliver them somewhere--and I guess I needed it, too. Because that&#x2019;s where this novel delivered me. <em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em> is a story of total collapse, and ultimately, reconstruction. Before it is over, this calamitous journey will cover five states, resulting in one birth, two arrests, and one instance of cannibalism and including a dust storm, a hail storm, several shit storms, and a six-hundred-mile cat-and-mouse pursuit by a mysterious Buick Skylark.</p> <p>Baggage is collected.</p> <p>Hearts are won and lost.</p> <p>Mistakes are forgiven.</p> <p>Futures are realized.</p> <p>This book represents nothing less than an emotional catharsis for its author. I wrote this book because I needed to. Because my sister went on a road trip thirty-nine years ago and never came back. And my family has yet to heal from this terrible fact. This novel is about the imperative of getting in that van, because you have no choice but to push yourself and drive on, and keep driving in the face of life&#x2019;s terrible surprises. It&#x2019;s about the people and the things you gather along that rough road back to humanity. And in the end, for me, <em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em> is the van in which I finally bring my sister home.</p>Jonathan Evison&nbsp;is&nbsp;the author of four previous novels, including&nbsp;<i>All About Lulu</i>,&nbsp;<i>West of Here</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Revised&nbsp;Fundamentals of Caregiving</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance!</i>&nbsp;He lives with his wife and family in&nbsp;Washington State.</p><h2>Tricky Business (Hardy Boys Mystery Stories)</h2><p>When Jimmy Quayle is accused of attempted murder, Frank and Joe decide to infiltrate the business where he worked, Trusty teens, in order to prove his innocence</p><p></p><h2>Handbook of Geomancy</h2><p>Pamphlet of Aleister Crowley&#39;s thoughts on Geomancy</p><p></p><h2>The National Lampoon Treasury of Humor</h2><p>A collection of some of the best pieces from &#34;National Lampoon&#34; magazine includes political satire and such articles as &#34;How Your Parents Had Sex,&#34; &#34;How to Talk Dirty in Esperanto,&#34; and &#34;The Ten Best Proms in America&#34;</p><p>This anthology's release coincides with the 20th anniversary of Lampoon. As Sarrantonio ( The Fireside Treasury of New Humor ) explains, it is "arranged as closesic as possible to a giant issue" of the magazine; it comprises samples from the publication's regular features, including a selection of stupefyingly unfunny staff-penned letters to the editor. The result is a fairly representative taste of the magazine's style and content: generally sophomoric, churlish and mean-spirited, full of tiresome bathroom humor and casual bigotry. There are a few exceptions, notably Michael O'Donoghue's mordant dissection of Johnny Carson's monologues, an intermittently amusing if overlong collection of sex scenes omitted from literary works like Plato's Republic , and Sean Kelly's clever poetic parodies. Other pieces, like John Weidman's mildly diverting send-up of Miguel Pinero's Short Eyes (featuring an escalating array of prison-made armaments, such as "a sawed-off shotgun made from clothesline and a deck of playing cards"), and most of the political satire, have dated badly.

For the rest of us with half a brain and some time to use it, this volume provides a little irreverent escapism amidst otherwise solemn reality.

There will be no mosquitoes, skunks or zippers to worry about when he watches a show about the joys of camping on his brand-new TV. But first Scaredy must find an electrical outlet, and that means going into the woods! Will the nutty worrywart&#39;s plans prepare him for the great outdoors, or will his adventure end up as a scary story told around the campfire?</p><p>M�lanie Watt is an acclaimed children&#39;s book author and illustrator. Her books include the Scaredy Squirrel, Chester and Learning With Animals series, Augustine, Leon the Chameleon and Have I Got a Book for You! She lives near Montreal.The need to plug in a new TV forces the squirrel with OCD tendencies into yet another outing. First, though, supplies must be gathered&#x2014;from rubber boots and bug netting to a very long extension cord. And because &#x201c;planning is everything!&#x201d; every conceivable hazard is charted (&#x201c;Keep a nose out for skunks. If sprayed, overreact!&#x201d;), a time line and a checklist of weather conditions compiled, and the adjacent campground carefully mapped. Alas, still one can&#x2019;t think of everything. A sudden encounter with a penguin results in a wild scramble that ultimately leads the redoubtable rodent to a new appreciation for the pleasures of camping under the stars. Scaredy Squirrel&#x2019;s meticulous preparations are, once again, captured in squared off, neatly arranged, carefully labeled cartoon illustrations, and his experiences may blaze a trail for readers with a similar aversion to venturing outdoors.

The story was immediately matched by a thrice marvelous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire. All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of Ichabod. . . .</p><p>Biographical Note Irving was born in New York on April 3, 1783. His father had come from the extreme north of Scotland, his mother from the extreme south of England; they had become American citizens by the fact of the Revolution a few years before the birth of their son. The elder Irving, a well-to-do merchant, destined the future author for the law, and he was in fact later called to the bar, though he practiced little. But his legal education was interrupted by an illness which led to a stay of two years in Europe. After he came home in 1806, he joined with his brother and J. K. Paulding in the production of the satirical miscellany, &#x201c;Salmagundi,&#x201d; and in 1809 published his first important work, &#x201c;A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty&#x201d; by &#x201c;Diedrich Knickerbocker.&#x201d; In 1815 Irving went to England on business, but he was unsuccessful in averting the disaster which threatened the commercial house in which he was a partner, and when he turned to writing again it was as a profession rather than as an amusement. His &#x201c;Sketch Book&#x201d; came out in 1819&#x2013;1820, and was followed by &#x201c;Bracebridge Hall&#x201d; in 1822 and &#x201c;Tales of a Traveller&#x201d; in 1824. These works met with gratifying success, and the author was now able to indulge in farther travel. During a prolonged residence at Madrid, he wrote his &#x201c;Life and Voyages of Columbus,&#x201d; and, after a sojourn in the south of Spain, his &#x201c;Conquest of Granada&#x201d; (1829) and &#x201c;The Alhambra&#x201d; (1832). Meantime he was appointed secretary to the American Embassy at London, a post which he held for three years. When he returned to America in 1832 after an absence of seventeen years, he was welcomed with great enthusiasm by his countrymen, who appreciated what he had done for the prestige of American literature in Europe.</p><h2>Pirate Alley: A Jake Grafton Novel (Jake Grafton Novels)</h2><p><p>Grafton and Carmellini are back and joined by the Navy SEALs to battle terrorists on the high seas in <i>Pirate Alley, </i>an action-packed tale by <i>New York Times</i> bestseller Stephen Coonts</p><p>A luxurious vacation cruise to the exotic locales of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden turns into a nightmare for passengers and crew when their ship is suddenly attacked and captured by a band of bloodthirsty Somali pirates. An initial rescue mission ends in failure; the decks are covered in blood. Unless they are paid a ransom of $200 million dollars within seven days, the pirates threaten to execute all their hostages. But information gleaned from a captured Al Qaeda operative indicates that there is a far more dangerous conspiracy afoot.</p><p>Once the ransom is paid, Islamic militants intend to swoop in and slaughter the passengers in an orgy of terror, hoping to provoke a massive American military response that will set the Muslim world aflame. Jake Grafton is assigned to negotiate with the brutal pirate chief while his right hand man, Tommy Carmellini, and a team of CIA and Navy SEAL operatives mount an undercover operation to save the hostages and keep the U.S. from being maneuvered into a murderous war.</p></p><p>STEPHEN COONTS is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestselling books that have been translated and published around the world.

He lives in Colorado.<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mogadishu, Somalia</p> <p>The little drone made a low buzzing sound, a bit more than a dragon- fly. It was about twice the size of that insect and weighed three and a half ounces.<br>We were on the roof of a three-story building. The locals would have been unhappy if they knew, but so far, our presence was our little secret.<br>I&#x2019;m Tommy Carmellini, and sneaking around is what the CIA pays me for. It&#x2019;s in my job description somewhere. I was here today with Travis Clay and Joe Bob Sweet, who were what the agency likes to refer to as &#x201c;covert operatives.&#x201d;<br>I watched the drone soar above our heads, watched Clay maneuver it around with the joystick on the control unit until he was sure it was functioning properly and the telemetry was good. I checked the small television screen, adjusted the contrast and brightness, and then nodded at Trav.He flew the drone off the edge of the roof and dropped it gently, stopping at each window as it came up on the monitor.<br>We thought our guy was in this three-story apartment building&#x2014;or what had once been an apartment building back when the people of<br>Somalia paid rent and obeyed laws. They didn&#x2019;t do either anymore.<br>Before we went in to get him, we wanted to know where in the building he was and who else was there, and in what rooms.<br>I watched the monitor over Travis&#x2019; shoulder, and when he flew the thing to the next window, I glanced around. We were squatting near a water tank. People on the street couldn&#x2019;t see us, and people some distance away, or across the street in that dump building, who couldn&#x2019;t tell who we were or what we were up to.<br>Mogadishu reminded me of some sections of Newark and Detroit, only worse. Dirt streets, trash, abandoned vehicles and ruined buildings, the stench of raw sewage, dirty people in rags carrying weapons . . . all in all, I thought it looked like hell might look when I got there. Seventeen years of civil war had brought them to this.<br>Believe it or not, when I joined the CIA I thought I would be spending my time in Europe or Russia or exotic places like China or Istanbul. I did a little of that, sure, but these days it seemed that the third&#x2014;no, make that the fourth&#x2014;world had my name upon it. Tommy Carmellini.<br>Using a device that picked up electromagnetic energy, I checked the satellite transceiver mounted on the roof one more time. It was hot. As amazing as it sounds, someone in the building was on the Internet.<br>After the drone had looked in every window, Travis flew it back to the roof and we conferred. The third-floor rooms were empty except for one man, who we thought was the guy we were after. Travis stowed the drone in his backpack.<br>I checked across the roof. Joe Bob Sweet was hunkered behind the re- mains of a chimney, keeping watch on the street below, the main drag.<br>Like me, Travis and Joe Bob were wearing dashikis and sported unruly beards. They also wore sweatbands that kept long, unkempt hair out of their eyes. Compared to them, I looked like a boot recruit. We smelled as bad as we looked.<br>I nodded at my two colleagues, who had their backpacks on and their weapons in their hands, then opened the door that led down into the building. I was following the wire from the satellite antenna. The installation expert hadn&#x2019;t bothered to drill holes in the walls or floors to get the wire out of the way; he had merely unrolled the thing, so it ran down the steep stairs, then along the poorly lit, trash-infested hallway to a closed door. The insulated wire ran under the door.<br>My little EMI receiver indicated the wire was hot.<br>Travis and Joe Bob already had silenced MP-5s in their hands. I put the electronic gizmo away and got out my Ruger with the silencer on the barrel. Travis looked at me and I looked at him as I slowly turned the knob on the door. Didn&#x2019;t see any locks. After all, locks only kept honest people out, and in Somalia, there weren&#x2019;t many of those folks left alive.<br>The door moved a millimeter.<br>I took a deep breath and opened it slowly, oh so slowly.<br>There was a guy sitting at a table by the window with his back to me. He was staring at a computer monitor; didn&#x2019;t see anyone else.<br>I walked across the space between us as slowly and silently as I could. The man must have seen my reflection in the computer screen, because he turned suddenly, startled. I jammed the silencer barrel against his teeth, and he froze.<br>Travis was right behind me. Joe Bob charged for the open doorway that led into another room, a room we couldn&#x2019;t see.<br>Fear. I could see it in the eyes of my guy. He was one scared fella, which was fine with me. He had a right to be. if he even twitched, I was going to kill him as dead as a man can get. Maybe he saw that in my face, because he remained frozen, immobile, as I turned him slightly and began checking him for weapons.<br>Behind me I heard a single shot, then a stutter from the MP-5. Then, another.&nbsp; I didn&#x2019;t even turn around.<br>Travis went charging for the other room. He was in there too long. <br>&#x201c;Guys?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Joe Bob caught one.&#x201d;<br>Shit! I thought this floor was empty!<br>The shot must have been heard all over this building. We had mere seconds.<br>&#x201c;Help me,&#x201d; I said urgently.<br>Travis whipped out a plastic tie and secured my computer guy&#x2019;s hands behind his back. Then he pulled out a preloaded syringe from a bag on his belt. &#x201c;Sweet&#x2019;s gut shot,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A fucking kid.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d he come from?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, fuck!&#x201d;<br>The computer guy was trying to watch Travis and me; his eyes got big as saucers when he saw the syringe. Whatever he had been expecting, that wasn&#x2019;t it.<br>Clay didn&#x2019;t bother pulling up the guy&#x2019;s sleeve or any of that nurse stuff; he merely jabbed the syringe needle through the dirty shirt straight into the muscle and pushed the plunger.<br>The guy collapsed before Clay could get the syringe put away. Clay stepped quickly back into the other room.<br>I stowed the Ruger and checked out the computer, which was an old IBM clone. I was prepared to operate&#x2014;take out the hard drive&#x2014;but saw that the computer box wasn&#x2019;t very big. I jerked the plugs off it, stuffed it into my backpack and carefully put both arms through the armholes.<br>I ran the three steps into the other room. Joe Bob had taken a slug right in the gut, then put three into the kid&#x2019;s heart. I merely glanced at the kid, sprawled across a filthy mattress. I saw he was small and dead; his pistol lay near his hand.<br>Joe Bob was on one knee, bleeding.<br>&#x201c;Help me get him up,&#x201d; I grunted at Travis. The two of us lifted Joe Bob onto my shoulder. He weighed about a hundred and eighty, so I wasn&#x2019;t going to move fast with him there. &#x201c;Goddamn fat slob,&#x201d; I told Sweet as I walked into the other room. Travis picked up the computer guy like he weighed about fifty pounds and tossed him over his shoulder. Clay weighed maybe a hundred and fifty, but it was all muscle and bone. <br>&#x201c;We got him,&#x201d; I said into my headset and received two mike clicks in reply.<br>Away we went, back the way we had come onto the roof. Kept going to another roof, then another. I wasn&#x2019;t going fast, not with Joe Bob draped over my shoulder and his MP-5 in my hands. If anyone was curious about the gunshot, they were waiting for the news to find them.<br>I could hear the chopper coming. Glanced around, saw it and stepped out where the pilot could see me. It was an Italian chopper and carried the markings of an Italian petroleum company.<br>There was just enough room on that roof. The pilot eased that thing in there slick as a whistle, and Travis tossed our prisoner through the open door onto the floor, then scrambled aboard. The crewman on the chopper helped me with Joe Bob, and then grabbed my hand and I vaulted in.<br>The floor came up and threatened to hit me in the face.<br>I turned and glanced at Travis, who was bent over Joe Bob working on him. He didn&#x2019;t have to say anything to me. I could see Joe Bob&#x2019;s pasty face and see his eyelids flutter as he tried to remain conscious. We were going to have to get him to a doctor quick or he was going to die.<br>The bad news was that the nearest doctor and surgical facility were at a French base in Tadjourah, Djibouti, which was at least eight hours away by chopper.<br>I looked at the unconscious computer guy and wondered if he was worth the life of Joe Bob Sweet, a twenty-nine year old Texan, a Special Forces sergeant on temporary duty with the CIA, an all-around good guy and father of two little towheaded kids.</p> <p>The chopper flew us northwest toward our base. Joe Bob bled out during the flight. After a while the brown eyes in his chalk face focused on infinity, and Travis and I could get no reaction from him. No pulse. No respiration.<br>I took a seat by the door and watched Africa go by.<br>A V-22 Osprey delivered us to the desert two weeks ago, to a site the experts had picked for us. Actually it was in Ethiopia, not Somalia, but I am probably not supposed to say that. I don&#x2019;t think anyone in the American government asked the Ethiopians if we could use their desert, but I am something of a cynic. It was about as lonely a place as one could find on the planet, and conditions were a bit Spartan. We hammered a tube into the ground to piss in and dug a hole to poop in. We erected four tents, built up dirt berms around them to stop shrapnel and bullets, and between them built a food and ammo dump below ground level. Two of the tents were for the other guys to sleep in, one housed the com gear, and one was mine. All mine. With my own cot and vermin and flashlight. I felt like an Eagle Scout.<br>We did some serious camping. The sand and dirt got into everything, including our food. We bitched a lot, but that didn&#x2019;t help. Gave up shaving. and bathing. Worked out every day, cleaned our weapons and played cards. At one point I was $152,000 ahead, but I lost twenty grand and the deed to my ranch the next da...</p></p><h2>Sound Friendships: The Story of Willa and Her Hearing Dog</h2><p>Sound Friendships is the story of Willa Macy, who lost her hearing when she was fourteen years old, and Honey, a golden retriever, who helped her to discover a new world of independence and security. It is also a story about Hearing Dogs--their background, training, special abilities, and the unique relationship they develop with their owners in working to surmount the barriers of a physical handicap.</p><p>Foreword by Sheila O'Brien. The executive director of the New England Assistance Dog Service (NEADS), Mrs. O'Brien holds a master's degree in special education, and she has had wide experience in working with people who are deaf and in the training of Hearing Dogs. <p>Books by Elizabeth Yates have won many awards, including the William Allen White Children's Book Award and the Newbery Medal. In 1987, the New Hampshire House of Representatives saluted her with a citation for lifelong achievement. </p><p>While writing Sound Friendships, Miss Yates observed the training and matching of dogs at the NEADS facility in Massachusetts and interviewed both new and experienced Hearing Dog owners. Her story of Willa is based on the experiences of two young women whom she met through the NEADS program.</p>Grade 5 Up The training of hearing aide dogs and the process of bonding with their deaf owners is the subject of this book that imparts information through the framework of a story. A young deaf woman, accepted into one of the few programs providing hearing ear service, is matched with a dog and attends an intensive training course. The remainder of the book details their first year together. The bonding process is presented as spiritual in nature as the hearing aide dog enhances the quality of life for its deaf owner. Indeed, although the writing is somewhat dry, the story presented here gives an upbeat portrait. The dog provides the woman with a way of overcoming obstacles. She becomes more self assured, gains recognition at the office, makes new friends, and becomes romantically involved. Yates was fortunate: she points out in regard to other owners and their dogs that there are sometimes compatibility problems. A more straightforward account is Patricia Curtis' Cindy, a Hearing Ear Dog (Dutton, 1981) which has less fictionalizing and presents information clearly and concisely. Curtis' book also has photographs and a list of organizations. Sound Friendships reads as a story, and information must be culled from it.

As persecution, war, and deportation savaged their communities, Jews tried to flee Nazi Europe through legal and clandestine routes. In their multifaceted tale of Jewish refugees during and after the Nazi era, Deb�rah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt braid the private and public realms, personal memory and official history. They probe the challenges faced by German Jewish refugees; the dispute among the Swiss on allowing Jews to cross their border; the dangers braved by covert guides who helped the hunted out of occupied France; and the creation of postwar displaced person camps, which have much to tell us about refugee camps today. Grounded in archival research throughout Europe and America, hundreds of oral histories, and thousands of newly discovered letters, <em>Flight from the Reich</em> shows how the lives of people thread together to form history.50 photos; 2 maps</p><p><p><strong>Deb�rah Dwork</strong> is the director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University. She lives in New Haven, Connecticut.</p><p><strong>Robert Jan van Pelt</strong> is a University Professor at the University of Waterloo. He lives in Toronto.</p>Tracking the plight of refugee Jews during and after the Nazi era, the authors of <i>Auschwitz</i> offer a comprehensive survey of various countries' responses to the refugee crisis and their often self-serving motives America, fearing immigrants would become public charges, required financial affidavits from American family or friends, which proved insurmountable for most European Jews. Britain granted visas to Jews of international repute, such as Sigmund Freud, but to only 50 Jews with licenses to practice medicine and 14,000 Jewish women willing to work as domestic servants. Eager to increase its white population, a racist Dominican Republic allowed healthy young refugees from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to work on large-scale agricultural colonies. Internment camps in the Soviet Union offered a chance for survival while detention camps in France were conduits to the concentration camps and death. The establishment of the state of Israel resolved postwar Jewish refugee problems but ironically triggered an immediate Jewish refugee flood from Muslim countries. Although well researched and written, this work's specialized focus deems it more appropriate for academics and others with a special interest in the Holocaust or refugee policy. 50 photos, 2 maps. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Adam and Eve, Abraham and Moses, Peter, John, and Jesus are all vividly portrayed in wonderful detail. The original Bible text captures all of the drama of the best-loved stories from the Bible, including Noah and the flood, Jonah's encounter with a great fish, and the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Here is a beautiful collection of Bible stories, perfect for gift-giving.<br><br>"An excellent choice for family or group use, as well as for independent reading." (<i>School Library Journal</i>, starred review)</p><p>Tomie dePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1934, to a family of Irish and Italian background. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.&nbsp; <p>His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for&nbsp;<i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion. He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, and received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for lifetime contribution to children's literature in 2011.</p> <p>DePaola has published almost 200 children's books in&nbsp;15 different countries over the past 30 years.&nbsp;Among his most well-known titles are the <i>Strega Nona </i>series, <i>26 Fairmount Avenue</i>, and <i>The Legend of the Indian Paintbrush.</i></p> <p>DePaola lives in an interesting house in New Hampshire with his four dogs. His studio is in a large renovated 200-year-old barn.</p>K Up-- A collection of 17 stories from the Old Testament, 15 from the New Testament, and 4 psalms. The text is from the New International Version, which is currently among the best-selling editions of the Bible and is written in clear, straightforward language. dePaola uses the text as written with some abridgement to make the stories an appropriate length. Done in his typical style, the illustrations feature stylized people and objects. His children are as winsome looking as ever, but the adults convey sincerity and trust through both facial expressions and body positions. He also makes good use of architectural and decorative detail. There are several illustrations for each story, many of which are full page, and most make dramatic use of color. The large format enhances the impact of the pictures.

He was happiest in the company of children for whom he created puzzles, clever games, and charming letters. <p> As all Carroll admirers know, his book <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland </em>(1865), became an immediate success and has since been translated into more than eighty languages. The equally popular sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There</em>, was published in 1872.</p> <p> The <b>Alice</b> books are but one example of his wide ranging authorship.<em> The Hunting of the Snark,</em> a classic nonsense epic (1876) and <em>Euclid and His Modern Rivals,</em> a rare example of humorous work concerning mathematics, still entice and intrigue today's students. <em>Sylvie and Bruno, </em>published toward the end of his life contains startling ideas including an 1889 description of weightlessness.</p> <p> The humor, sparkling wit and genius of this Victorian Englishman have lasted for more than a century.

[Eyewitness series] -- <i>School Library Journal</i></p><h2>W C Fields</h2><p>In addition to the text, there are numerous photos throughout the book.</p><p>James Curtis's <i>W.C. Fields</i> is the finest biography of the bulb-nosed comedian ever published, allowing the <i>real</i> Fields (1880-1946) to emerge after decades of obfuscation. Fields was always presumed to be the same boozy, child-hating curmudgeon that he played on stage and screen, but Curtis (author of acclaimed biographies of directors Preston Sturges and James Whale) shows us a multidimensional Fields who triumphed in every facet of show business from vaudeville and Broadway to radio and film. A world-class juggler, Fields (born William Claude Dukenfield, in Philadelphia) honed his act for each new venue, evolving out of necessity as silent movies gave way to the advent of sound. As Fields enjoys the luxuries of Hollywood stardom, the pleasure of Curtis's book grows glamorously infectious.<p> This is also the semi-tragic story of a sickly alcoholic, prevented by Catholic restriction from divorcing his second wife, resulting in decades of estrangement from his only legitimate son. This lends poignancy to Fields that his comedy rarely revealed, but for every episode of bitter resentment, Curtis offers touching evidence of Fields's personal and professional generosity. Domestic passages are most revealing, both melancholy (for Fields, idleness was misery) and hilarious (as when he wages war on aggressive swans near his lakefront estate). Curtis also sets the record straight on Fields's numerous bank accounts, love affairs, and other Fields-related legends. As a biographer's act of compassion, Curtis chooses a perfect (and perfectly devastating) posthumous detail to end this remarkable book, essentially reuniting Fields with the family he never really had. If all comedy is born of pain, Curtis proves that Fields was the consummate comedian. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i></p>Before he ever made a movie or spoke a word onstage, W. C. Fields was one of the greatest pantomimists and comedians in the world. His career spanned the whole of the twentieth century?in burlesque, vaudeville, the legitimate stage, silent pictures, talkies, radio, books, and recordings. Only death prevented him from working in television. <br><br>He shared the vaudeville stage with Sarah Bernhardt and Houdini; he made a command performance before Edward VII; he was compared to Chaplin and Keaton and became one of the great comedians in radio. He wrote, directed, and performed (Mae West and Fields were among the first writer/actor/directors) in some of the most enduring and brilliant comedies of all time, including It?s a Gift, My Little Chickadee, and The Bank Dick. He appeared in fifty pictures and wrote fifteen of them. His understanding of the need to lie and swindle, and his ability to make the most innocent phrase sound lewd, made him a star. <br><br>Now James Curtis tells the story of Fields? life and work. Drawing on Fields? papers and manuscripts, he shows us the passion and intellect that fueled Fields? talent and the background that gave such bite and edge to his comedy. Curtis shows us, in illuminating detail, just how Fields? extraordinary art evolved on the stage in the early part of the twentieth century and how he not only incorporated it into his films, but how it came to define his persona decades later.<br><br>He writes of Fields? hardscrabble Philadelphia childhood; of his father, a drunken breaker of horses who beat his son; of Fields? clever hands that were quick to master stealing and juggling (he took up the latter?it allowed him to sleep late); of his years in burlesque and minstrelsy; of his seventeen years in vaudeville, hopping trains early on, living a life half in the theater, half on the lam, making his way into the big time, never satisfied with his ?act,? always working on something newer and more striking. Curtis writes of Fields? starring years with the Ziegfeld Follies, finding his voice and his character amid one of the greatest assemblages of comic talent on a single stage (Will Rogers, Eddie Cantor, Fanny Brice, among others); appearing in every Ziegfeld show from 1915 through 1921; of his marriage to a fellow performer, the birth of their son, and their travels together on the Circuit, until Mrs. Fields decided she?d had enough and left?the theater and her marriage. Fields never again loved so deeply. <br><br>We see Fields? extraordinary work in the movies, both silent pictures in New York (first directed by D. W. Griffith in the starring role in Sally of the Sawdust, which Fields created on Broadway in Poppy) and in the talkies from 1927 to 1945. <br><br>Curtis? biography narrates the life and the art of the actor James Agee called ?the toughest and most warmly human of all screen comedians.?</p><h2>The Dream Game</h2><p>A fine anthology that is a good introduction to the thoughts of the father of psychoanalysis.</p><p></p><h2>The Dark Side Sourcebook (Star Wars Roleplaying Game)</h2><p><b>If only you knew the power of the dark side....</b><br><br>The Force is an all-encompassing energy field generated by all living things.

Six weeks before he came, revolution had erupted half by accident, and, spreading from city to city in swaying battle against the Imperial forces, was about to overcome the decrepit Manchu regime. Haphazard in outbreak it was to be imperfect in triumph for it failed to fill the void left by what it swept away. The monarchy which had held together a quarter of the earth&#x2019;s population found no firm successor. Fragmenting under rival claimants and already penetrated by a maze of foreign inroads into her sovereignty, China with lost cohesion and damaged confidence moved into the oncoming storms of the world&#x2019;s most violent age.<br><br>The visitor, on leave from military duty in the Philippines, was as pure Yankee in heritage as it was possible to be. He was the eighth generation in direct descent from Nicholas Stilwell, who had come to America from England in 1638 and acquired property in Staten Island, Long Island and Manhattan. His mother&#x2019;s forebears named Fowler had also arrived in the 1630s and over succeeding generations had gathered in the major strains of colonial America: English, French Huguenot and Dutch. Nicholas Stilwell had produced some 1,600 descendants by the time Joe Stilwell was born, of whom two, Colonel Richard Stilwell and General Garrett Stilwell, fought in the American Revolution.<br><br>A military career was not so much chosen by Joe as thrust on him by paternal whim. His father, Dr. Benjamin W. Stilwell, was a clever and handsome gentleman of authoritative character, comfortable circumstances and a variety of talents not carried too far. He was the son of John Stilwell, a dry-goods merchant of &#x201c;business sagacity and exemplary habits&#x201d; who had retired with a considerable fortune derived from investment in real estate and settled in Yonkers where he built an attractive house overlooking the Hudson and became a director of the Bank of Yonkers and a pillar of the Methodist Church. The family home remained in Yonkers thereafter.<br><br>Benjamin Stilwell took a law degree at Columbia when he was twenty-one but did not establish himself in practice. Following his marriage in 1880 to Mary A. Peene, and the birth of a daughter, he moved to a plantation near Palatka, Florida, with the intention of developing a lumber business in southern pine. Here on March 19, 1883, his first son was born and named Joseph Warren for the friend and physician who attended at his birth. The name had been inherited from the original Dr. Joseph Warren of Boston who, refusing the post of Surgeon General for a more hazardous active command, was killed in the Battle of Bunker Hill.<br><br>Abandoning the venture in lumber, Benjamin Stilwell returned with his family to Yonkers where he now took up the study of medicine and obtained a degree, but this profession too failed to attract him into practice. In 1892 the family, enlarged by a second son, John, and a second daughter, Mary, moved to a farm near Great Barrington in the Berkshires where Dr. Stilwell decided to take up the role of country gentleman. After four years he came to the conclusion that he was failing in the duty he owed society to make use of his endowments and so returned once again to Yonkers where he now accepted a position with a public utility, the Westchester Lighting Company, ultimately becoming vice-president.<br><br>Having at last satisfied the prodding of the puritan conscience which will not allow a man to live guiltlessly without a job, Dr. Stilwell enjoyed life thereafter as one of Yonkers&#x2019; distinguished citizens, holding office as president of the school board and various directorships of Westchester banks and companies. With his imposing but genial presence and considerable charm, Dr. Benjamin Stilwell was accepted at face value by his family and community as a superior person. &#x201c;Father was impressive&#x201d; was the verdict of a daughter. He had the manner and means to carry off the posture of prominence as well as the evident abilities which he never used to their fullest or tested in a more exigent world than Yonkers. He took his family to Paris in the centennial year of 1889, conducting them through England, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria and Italy and sending home a series of entertaining and well-written travel letters to the Yonkers Statesman. He painted and played the piano, maintained a strict hand and high moral tone over the upbringing of his children, presided and asked the blessing three times a day at the family dining table, entertained the family with a flow of stories, wit, advice and instruction, and enjoyed the devoted admiration of his sons and daughters, who believed, or were educated in the habit of believing, that Father was wonderful&#x2014;and always right.<br><br>Joe Stilwell, called Warren by his family, was an active, driving, sharp-witted boy who climbed rooftops, drowned rabbits in the horse trough and exceedingly disliked Sunday services which he was required to attend three times in the day, including church, Sunday school and a sermon at vespers. Writing to his own daughter when he was over sixty, he recalled the &#x201c;criminal instincts I picked up by being forced to go to Church and Sunday School, and seeing how little real good religion does anybody, I advise passing them all up and using common sense instead.&#x201d;<br><br>Like his father, Warren had facility with words, but his heart and energy went into athletics. He played tennis, rowed a shell on the Hudson and played quarterback on the Yonkers High football team of which, in the words of a classmate, he was &#x201c;the motive power, inspiration and field general.&#x201d; When under his generalship the varsity of 1889 defeated all the prep school teams of New York City and Westchester, the public high school of Yonkers was so pleased that it paid its players. On the track team Warren&#x2019;s specialty was the quarter-mile and his interest carried over to organizing track meets of the Westchester Inter-Scholastic League which he helped to form and serving as reporter of athletic events for the Yonkers Statesman. Organizing athletics was to remain a lifelong activity along with a passion for keeping himself in physical trim at the athlete&#x2019;s level.<br><br>At the end of his senior year in 1889 the final report of the principal, Dr. Thomas O. Baker, described a model boy&#x2014;as it proved, a little prematurely. The subject maintained &#x201c;a high standard in all his studies,&#x201d; possessed &#x201c;energy and executive ability . . . useful in advancing the interests of the school,&#x201d; had &#x201c;no bad habits&#x201d; and was &#x201c;entirely worthy of confidence.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Stilwell had chosen Yale for his sons but he now decided that at sixteen Warren was too young to go to college and, on the theory that the right place for every child was at home, he ordained that his able, bright, extra-energized, highly effective son should take a postgraduate year at Yonkers in the same school system in which he had been, with a brief interval, since he was five. Ironically, it was this over-protective gesture which diverted Joe Stilwell to a military career. Predictably bored, he soon departed from his estimable record. Forming a club of friends called the &#x201c;Big Four,&#x201d; he constructed a hideaway in the school loft with boards laid across the rafters where the group played cards and on one occasion suspended the principal&#x2019;s desk by ropes from the ceiling. In another venture they spread Limburger cheese on the pupils&#x2019; desks, and in climactic naughtiness, at the senior dance of 1900, perpetrated what came to be known as the Great Ice Cream Raid. Led by Warren, the four marauders assaulted the refreshment table and after doing battle with the defenders, in the course of which Dr. Baker was inadvertently &#x201c;slugged,&#x201d; made off with the tubs of ice cream and trays of cakes. A special meeting of the Board of Education to deal with the scandal was summoned the next day, at which the guilty boys were variously suspended, expelled or not allowed to graduate, leaving Warren, who had already graduated, a special case.<br><br>Though at first unable to believe that a Stilwell could be guilty of misbehavior, Dr. Stilwell upon investigation confirmed the unhappy truth. He decided discipline was needed: Warren must go into the Army. He seems not to have taken a severe or punishing attitude for he told Warren (according to a version adopted if not authenticated by the family) that &#x201c;there is a nice place up the Hudson where you can play tennis.&#x201d; Although his father&#x2019;s decision cost Warren the chance to play football at Yale, he made, as far as is known, no objection. Indeed, with the United States having recently tossed off a &#x201c;splendid little war&#x201d; in Cuba and still engaged in fighting Insurrectos in the Philippines, and with American infantry at that moment shooting their way along with other foreign troops to the rescue of the Legations besieged in Peking by the Boxer Rebellion, the prospect of being a soldier may have appealed to a boy suffering from both paternal smothering and a surfeit of high school.<br><br>In any event he seems to have plunged with characteristic intensity into the endeavor of gaining admission to West Point; a neighbor remembers his having stayed in bed for a week on the interesting theory that he could in this way stretch himself a quarter-inch to meet the height requirement for a cadet.<br><br>As it was already late to apply for an appointment to the Military Academy, Dr. Stilwell pulled wires. Through a neighbor across the street who was a friend of President McKinley, Warren was given an appointment as an alternate-at-large. On the application form Dr. Stilwell lightly penciled in the blanks before allowing his son to copy them over in ink. At the ordeal of the qualifying examinations Warren thought he had failed in mathematics, but when the names of those failing to qualify were mercilessly read aloud, he found himself, to his surprise, left in line with the successful remainder.<br><br>The student body in which he was now included did not represent a military caste such as was built into European society. Out of close to 4,000 officers who had graduated from West Point by the year 1900 only 139 or 3.5 percent were the sons or grandsons of previous graduates. Traditionally suspicious of &#x201c;militarism,&#x201d; Congress had retained the power of appointment to the Academy, and from fear of allowing a military caste to develop, tended to lean away from the sons of officers in favor of civilians&#x2019; sons. Its nominations brought together a group mainly of conservative, native-born, middle- and upper-middle-class background. Ages ranged in the first year from seventeen to twenty-two, with Stilwell among the youngest. The newest recruits on that July day in 1900 raced to the telegraph office to notify their families and then, as Stilwell wrote in his diary, &#x201c;went back to hell.&#x201d;<br><br>For plebe year at West Point in 1900 the description was not inappropriate. Hazing had reached an extreme at this time which, after the withdrawal and subsequent death of two cadets from causes attributed to hazing, brought on a Congressional investigation in February 1901. Among those required to testify, much against his will, was Douglas MacArthur, in the class a year ahead of Stilwell, who had lain on his cot in convulsions after a session of &#x201c;exercising.&#x201d; Plebes were made to squat over bayonets, to run naked while buckets of cold water were thrown at them, to be hanged from their thumbs or to stand on their heads in the bath, to hold a rifle on extended arms for long periods, to be &#x201c;sweated&#x201d; (wrapped in blankets and raincoats in July), to swallow Tabasco sauce or eat vast quantities of a food such as a plateful of molasses or two hundred prunes, to engage in forced fights or eat meals under the table and to suffer various other humiliations.<br><br>The practice was not entirely wanton. Its excuse was that, like the rigid routines of the official regime, it was said to teach self-control, resistance to panic and, above all, acceptance of authority. The core of the military profession is discipline and the essence of discipline is obedience. Since this does not come naturally to men of independent and rational mind, they must train themselves in the habit of obedience on which lives and the fortunes of battle may some day depend. Reasonable orders are easy enough to obey; it is capricious, bureaucratic or plain idiotic demands that form the habit of discipline. Of these, bracing at West Point&#x2014;a frozen stance with shoulders squeezed back, chin and stomach sucked in&#x2014;was the symbol and the essence.<br><br>&#x201c;Brace, brace, brace,&#x201d; Stilwell wrote in his diary, &#x201c;drill, drill, drill. Oh, Lord. . . . Sink, setting up drill, drink, rest, squad drill, dinner, clean guns, squad drill, retreat, company drill around the area before supper. . . . Taps, oblivion, reveille at 4:30, brace all the time, at meals between every mouthful, had to brace on toes for an hour-and-a-half once.&#x201d; Upper-classmen made bracing a constant torture. Sometimes plebes had to work &#x201c;holding tissue paper between shoulder blades (a cinch when wet).&#x201d; During tent camp in summer he was subjected to a &#x201c;soiree&#x201d; of hazing which he could describe only incoherently as &#x201c;smoking and poking skags at your chin. And hell sauce. Oh, joy. Rat funerals and bugs. Watch &#x2019;em with crossed bayonets for hours.&#x201d; Joe (as he was now and hereafter known except to his family) was homesick, miserable and constipated, a condition with which he was often concerned throughout life. &#x201c;Overslept once till guns went off&#x2014;scared to death. . . . Made beds, swept up tents, looed up walls, dragged water, put in collars and cuffs . . . cussed out all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>He found escape in adventure stories borrowed from the library, among them Kidnapped, The Luck of Roaring Camp, King Solomon&#x2019;s Mines, Under Two Flags, Les Mis�rables and a sport on this list, De Quincy&#x2019;s Confessions of an Opium Eater. He kept the last out for the longest time, two weeks compared to two to five days for the others.<br><br>Eventually plebe year was over, and like coming into the sunlight out of some dark tunnel, he emerged an upper-classman. The curriculum of the Military Academy at this time was designed to produce an officer ab ovo and concentrated on the technical knowledge needed by a soldier with little attention to the possibly wider needs of a citizen. A student emerged marvelously proficient in drawing maps and terrain features but less well versed in the history of man and his institutions. The humanities were confined to one course in history and one in English language, literature and composition combined. Otherwise the cadet took French and Spanish, math, chemistry, law and &#x201c;natural philosophy&#x201d; (which meant a smattering of the physical sciences), plus his military subjects. In addition to drill regulations, these were ordnance and gunnery, surveying, fortifications, tactics and two years of drawing which included topography and plotting of surveys, shades and shadows, linear perspective, theory of color and laying of tints, field reconnaissance contouring, history of cartography, engineering and ordnance drawing, freehand landscape and enough more to equip a Leonardo.</p><h2>Whirligigs: Design and Construction (Chilton Hobby Series)</h2><p>Traces the history of the whirligig, provides complete plans for making birds, animals, and people, and includes tips on weathervanes and mechanical whirligigs</p><p></p><h2>Death in Disguise (Midsomer Murders - Featuring Inspector Barnaby)</h2><p>When a death at the big house is announced to the village of Compton Dando, few people are surprised, as &#34;The Golden Windhorse&#34; is home to some new-age oddballs.

But this story is so dense with rich characterizations as to seem a new genre. Graham nests her murder plots in gentle social satire; this one pokes affectionate fun at the fringes of mysticism and New Age cults. But her characters are not stereotypes; each flawed and foolish one finds a different way to tug at the reader&#39;s heartstrings. Hugh Ross&#39;s performance adds luster to an already sparkling book. His narration sounds delightfully spontaneous, and his mildly exaggerated vocal characterizations (including a bravura turn as the Valkyric cello-playing priestess) perfectly match the author&#39;s style.

What if I have encountered God in some profound way? Which experiences are from God and which are of my own making? Are there right and wrong ways to pray? What about my ordinary life in the everyday world? </i>"Mystics are not part of a small elite society.... Rather, they are people who have come to experience the intense, personal desire God has to share himself with us." In this lively guide, Steven Rossetti reminds us that becoming a mystic is not a matter of learning some "mystical secret," but of entering into the divine simplicity of God's unbounded and unrestrained love. This invitation is for all of us. In a series of practical, readable chapters, Rossetti addresses the many questions and concerns that arise on the path to deeper prayer. He draws carefully from the wisdom of scripture and uses his broad knowledge of mystical writers, from the Desert Fathers to Therese of Lisieux, to guide us on a road we may never have expected to take. Writing from his own experience of prayer and from his expertise as a spiritual director and therapist, he helps us arrive at a deeper understanding of ourselves as wounded and sinful people who are nevertheless caught up in the transforming love of God.</p><p>Msgr. Stephen J. Rossetti, a priest of the Diocese of Syracuse, is a licensed psychologist with a doctorate in psychology from Boston College and a doctor of ministry from the Catholic University of America. He is the author of scores of articles and several books including <i>Why Priests are Happy, Born of the Eucharist</i>, and <i>The Joy of Priesthood</i>--recipient of a Catholic Press Association book award. Rossetti has been featured on NPR and <i>Meet the Press</i>, and has been quoted in the <i>New York Times, Washington Post</i>, and other major newspapers.<br><br>Rossetti has received a Proclaim Award from the USCCB as well as a Lifetime Service Award from the Theological College of the Catholic University of America. In 2013, he was awarded the Pope John Paul II Seminary Leadership award from the National Catholic Educational Association.

Here she offers the recipes she makes over and over again because they&#39;re easy, they work, and they&#39;re universally loved. *For a leisurely Sunday breakfast, she has Easy Cheese Danishes or Breakfast Fruit Crunch to serve with the perfect Spicy Bloody Mary. *For lunch, she has classics with a twist, such as Tomato, Mozarella and Pesto Panini and Old-Fashioned Potato salad, which are simply delicious. *Then there are Ina&#39;s homey dinners - from her own version of loin of pork stuffed with sauteed fennel to the exotic flavours of Eli&#39;s Asian Salmon. *And there are outrageously luscious sweets like Peach and Blueberry Crumble and Pumpkin Mousse Parfait. Ina also lets readers in on her time-tested strategies for cooking and entertaining - from what she considers when she&#39;s designing a kitchen, to menu-planning basics. In this beautifully illustrated book, Ina Garten proves beyond a shadow of doubt that there truly is no place like home.</p><p>Ina Garten is the author of seven bestselling cookbooks, star of the Barefoot Contessa TV show on the Good Food Channel. She writes a monthly column for House Beautiful and lives in East Hampton, USA.Garten's fifth cookbook (after <i>Barefoot in Paris</i>) follows her surefire formula: uncomplicated but elegant recipes for the home cook whose priority is spending time with friends and family, not in the kitchen. From breakfast to dessert, the Food Network star organizes this volume by meal, with an easy-to-navigate recipe list at the top of each section. Many entries provide a creative alternative to the basics: the Summer Borscht&#x2014;which calls for fresh beets, cucumber and chicken stock&#x2014;will make a cool, flavorful substitute for the predictable bowl of gazpacho, and the mayonnaise-based Jon Snow's Fish Salad&#x2014;freshly roasted white fish filets (e.g., halibut) distinguished by the addition of diced fennel&#x2014;will supersede tuna salad. But some of Garten's "feel-good" foods barely warrant inclusion&#x2014;her recipe for Sunday Morning Oatmeal barely elevates the instructions on the Quaker canister. If not always inventive, these recipes (e.g., Cornish Hens with Cornbread Stuffing) should be reliable for seasoned but time-pressed or ambitious but inexperienced cooks. Striking a warm, personal tone, Garten also includes advice on designing a kitchen, making a grocery list, planning a menu and where to shop and dine in the Hamptons. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The principal text is the first English translation of Roch�&#x2019;s novel <i>Victor</i>, an account of his friendship with Duchamp (nicknamed Victor by his close friends in those days). Although unfinished, Roch�&#x2019;s text offers a unique account of New York Dada, all of whose principal characters and events make an appearance: Francis Picabia, Arthur Cravan, the Arensbergs and their soir�es, the Blind Man&#x2019;s Ball and the scandal of Duchamp&#x2019;s "Fountain" at the Independents exhibition, a pivotal moment in modern art. The novel offers interesting insights into the sexual politics of the period, when a woman could be arrested or blackmailed for spending the night with a man to whom she was not married. Roch�, a lifelong friend of Duchamp, appears to have been something of a devotee of triangular relationships, and went on to write a more famous novel on the topic (also autobiographical), <i>Jules et Jim</i>--later made into a film by Fran�ois Truffaut. Beatrice Wood&#x2019;s account of these events is taken from her memoirs; she went on to become a celebrated ceramicist, dying in 1998 aged 105. The introduction and commentary is by Dawn Ades, the well-known scholar of Dada and Surrealism.</p><p></p><h2>Encyclopedia of magic and superstition: Alchemy, charms, dreams, omens, rituals, talismans, wishes</h2><p>Only damage is to dust jacket.

In the tradition of Carl Schorske's Fin de Siecle Vienna, Karl Beckson shows how in the 1890s London drew together and nurtured the seeds of modernism. Here are the great figures of that time - Wilde, Shaw, Yeats, Beardsley, Kipling, Gladstone, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, among many others - engaged in the movements and debates, the great shifts in public behavior and feeling, that would make the world we know. The result is an entertaining cultural history that brings before us the time and the place where Victorianism gave birth to modernism.</p><p>The extraordinary literary, artistic, and philosophical movements spawned in London during the penultimate years of Victoria's reign are the themes of this lucid and engaging book. Chapter by chapter, Beckson (English, CUNY) examines cultural trends and their proponents, among them Fabianism (Shaw and the Webbs), Decadence (Wilde et al.), the Rhymers Club (Yeats and Le Gallienne, among others), and the New Drama (Shaw, Pinero, and Wilde again). Other chapters address Victorian fin-de-siecle attitudes toward such disparate social questions as feminism, prostitution, and homosexuality, with the book's literal centerpiece being the 1895 trial of Oscar Wilde. To paraphrase Matthew Arnold, this work presents a time and place caught between two worlds, one dead (or dying) and the other generating the power to be born; its insight into the end and beginning of eras will be an asset for any academic collection. For a view of London earlier in the 19th century, see London--World City: 1800-1840 , reviewed below.--Ed.<br><i>- Linda Smith, Mobil Corp. Lib., Fairfax, Va.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.In London at the end of the 19th century, early cultural manifestations of modernism, marked by scientific advances and experimental expression in the arts, began to disturb the relative stability of the Victorian age. In this scholarly, extensively researched cultural history, Beckson ( Arthur Symons: A Life ) explores the "arts for art's sake" Aesthetic movement led by writer Oscar Wilde, the Naturalistic techniques of novelist Emile Zola and the mysticism in the poetry of William Butler Yeats. The growth of the industrial state, the new middle class and widespread urban poverty and prostitution sparked such reform movements as socialism and the battle for women's suffrage. Also reviewing writing that called for enlightened attitudes toward homosexuals, Beckson's chronicle should be of interest mainly to researchers and historians.

Already celebrated for his unflinching portrayals of Tokyo in collections such as <i>Tokyo Still Life</i> and <i>Tokyo Lucky Hole</i>, the Japanese photographer embraced the opportunity to turn his lens onto London and Paris, two of Europe&#x2019;s most historic, dynamic, and culturally diverse capitals. Much more than a travelogue, <i><b>Dirty Pretty Things</b></i> is also an account of the emotional journey of the photographer and the two women he loves. <br><br>Also included are excerpts from Araki&#x2019;s journal, in which he reflects on subjects as varied as travel and the nature of photography.

As he crossed the Congo River in an almost empty ferry boat, all he could see were lines of people trying to travel the other way&#x2014;out of the Congo. Within his first two weeks he found himself on the wrong end of a revolver as militiamen played Russian-roulette, Congo style, with him.<p> During his first year, the charismatic and reckless political leader, Patrice Lumumba, was murdered and Devlin was widely thought to have been entrusted with (he was) and to have carried out (he didn't) the assassination. Then he saved the life of Joseph Desire Mobutu, who carried out the military coup that presaged his own rise to political power. Devlin found himself at the heart of Africa, fighting for the future of perhaps the most strategically influential country on the continent, its borders shared with eight other nations. He met every significant political figure, from presidents to mercenaries, as he took the Cold War to one of the world's hottest zones. This is a classic political memoir from a master spy who lived in wildly dramatic times.</p></p><p><b>Larry Devlin</b> was raised in California, enlisted in the army reaching the grade of captain in World War II, joined the CIA in 1949 and was appointed Chief of Station Congo in 1959.

Hatterr is the son of a European merchant officer and a lady from Penang who has been raised and educated in missionary schools in Calcutta. His story is of his search for enlightenment as, in the course of visiting seven Oriental cities, he consults with seven sages, each of whom specializes in a different aspect of � Living.� Each teacher delivers himself of a great � Generality,� each great Generality launches a new great � Adventure,� from each of which Hatter escapes not so much greatly edified as by the skin of his teeth. The book is a comic extravaganza, but as Anthony Burgess writes in his introduction, � it is the language that makes the book. . . .

Reprint. Tour.</p><p>In <i>Big Fish</i>, Daniel Wallace angles in search of a father and hooks instead a fictional debut as winning as any this year. From his son's standpoint, Edward Bloom leaves much to be desired. He was never around when William was growing up; he eludes serious questions with a string of tall tales and jokes. This is subject matter as old as the hills, but Wallace's take is nothing if not original. Desperate to know his father before he dies, William recreates his father's life as the stuff of legend itself. In chapters titled "In Which He Speaks to Animals," "How He Tamed the Giant," "His Immortality," and the like, Edward Bloom walks miles through a blizzard, charms the socks off a giant, even runs so fast that "he could arrive in a place before setting out to get there." In between these heroic episodes, Bloom dies not once but four times, working subtle variations on a single scene in which he counters his son's questions with stories--some of which are actually very witty, indeed. After all, he admits, "...if I shared my doubts with you, about God and love and life and death, that's all you'd have: a bunch of doubts. But now, see, you've got all these great jokes." The structure is a clever conceit, and the end product is both funny and wise. At the heart of both legends and death scenes live the same age-old questions: Who are you? What matters to you? Was I a good father? Was I a good son? In mapping the territory where myth meets everyday life, Wallace plunges straight through to fatherhood's archaic and mysterious heart. <i>--Mary Park</i><p>&#x201c;A charming whopper of a tale.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br><br>In his prime, Edward Bloom was an extraordinary man. He could outrun anybody. He never missed a day of school. He saved lives and tamed giants. Animals loved him, people loved him, women loved him. He knew more jokes than any man alive. At least that&#x2019;s what he told his son, William. But now Edward Bloom is dying, and William wants desperately to know the truth about his elusive father&#x2014;this indefatigable teller of tall tales&#x2014;before it&#x2019;s too late. So, using the few facts he knows, William re-creates Edward&#x2019;s life in a series of legends and myths, through which he begins to understand his father&#x2019;s great feats, and his great failings. The result is hilarious and wrenching, tender and outrageous.</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Refreshing, original . . . Wallace mixes the mundane and the mythical.

Through a combination of research, memory, and exaggeration, Ward voices ideas concerning the relationship between history and the present, art and life, parents and children, husbands and wives. Set in many parts of the West, Angle of Repose is a story of discovery--personal, historical, and geographical--that endures as Wallace Stegner's masterwork: an illumination of yesterday's reality that speaks to today's.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angle of Repose is a long, intricate, deeply rewarding novel," wrote William Abrahams in the Atlantic Monthly. "[It] is neither the predictable historical-regional Western epic, nor the equally predictable four-decker family saga, the Forsytes in California, so to speak. . . . For all [its] breadth and sweep, Angle of Repose achieves an effect of intimacy, hence of immediacy, and, though much of the material is 'historical,' an effect of discovery also, of experience newly minted rather than a pageantlike re-creation. . . . Wallace Stegner has written a superb novel, with an amplitude of scale and richness of detail altogether uncommon in contemporary fiction."<br>"Angle of Repose is a novel about Time, as much as anything--about people who live through time, who believe in both a past and a future. . . . It reveals how even the most rebellious crusades of our time follow paths that our great-grandfathers' feet beat dusty."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Wallace Stegner<b>Wallace Stegner</b> was born in 1909 in Lake Mills, Iowa. The son of Scandinavian immigrants, he traveled with his parents and brother all over the West-to North Dakota, Washington, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Wyoming-before settling in Salt Lake City in 1921. Many of the landscapes he encountered in his peripatetic youth figure largely in his work, as do characters based on his stern father and athletic, outgoing brother. Stegner received most of his education in Utah, graduating from the University in 1930. He furthered his education at the University of Iowa, where he received a master's and a doctoral degree. He married Mary Stuart Page in 1934, and for the next decade the couple followed Wallace's teaching career-to the University of Wisconsin, Harvard, and eventually to Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program, and where he was to remain until his retirement in 1971. A number of his creative writing students have become some of today's most well respected writers, including Wendell Berry, Thomas McGuane, Raymond Carver, Edward Abbey, Robert Stone, and Larry McMurty.<br><br>Throughout his career and after, Stegner's literary output was tremendous. His first novel, Remembering Laughter, was published in 1937. By the time of his death in 1993 he had published some two dozen works of fiction, history, biography, and essays. Among his many literary prizes are the Pulitzer Prize for <b>Angle of Repose</b> (1971) and the National Book Award for <b>The Spectator Bird </b>(1976). His collection of essays, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b> (1992), was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle award.<p><br>Although his fiction deals with many universal themes, Stegner is primarily recognized as a writer of the American West. Much of his literature deals with debunking myths of the West as a romantic country of heroes on horseback, and his passion for the terrain and its inhabitants have earned him the title 'The Dean of Western Letters'. He was one of the few true Men of Letters in this generation. An historian, essayist, short story writer and novelist, as well as a leading environmental writer. Although always connected in people's minds with the West, he had a long association with New England. Many short stories and one of his most successful novels, Crossing to Safety, are set in Vermont, where he had a summer home for many years. Another novel, <b>The Spectator Bird</b>, takes place in Denmark.</p><p><br>An early environmentalist, he actively championed the region's preservation and was instrumental-with his now-famous 'Wilderness Letter'-in the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Honest and straightforward, educated yet unpretentious, cantankerous yet compassionate, <b>Wallace Stegner</b> was an enormous presence in the American literary landscape, a man who wrote and lived with ferocity, energy, and integrity.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Jackson J.

Sarah&#39;s two young daughters are excited, as is her own mother (Jennifer Rees Larcombe). But the happiness is shortlived, as the scan at the hospital reveals that the baby has a condition which will mean severe skeletal deformity. Birth will be fatal.Sarah and husband Paul decide to go to full term and not abort, which does not go down well with the hospital. So their personal anguish is exacerbated by the fight to maintain the baby&#39;s own dignity as a human being. Naming her is important - and they decide on Cerian, which is Welsh for &#39;loved one&#39;. The following chapters allow us to join Sarah and her family on the difficult journey towards Cerian&#39;s birthday, which will also be her deathday.But Sarah gives us more - she allows us into her walk with God. The anger, the fear, and ultimately the place of peace and acceptance.This book is one of the most powerful testimonies to God&#39;s grace we have ever published. Its impact will be personal and political - Sarah has already had an impromptu session with the World Health Organisation who were eager to hear her perspective. It&#39;s not often they encounter a mother who has both this kind of experience and the ability to articulate so many of the issues it raises. The title, based on 1 Corinthians 1:27 &#39;God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong&#39;, throws out a challenge to a society that&#39;s poised to pass laws which threaten the very existence of its weaker members.</p><p></p><h2>The Book of Mean People</h2><p>&#34;This is a book about mean people. Some mean people are big. Some little people are mean.&#34; In Toni Morrison&#39;s second illustrated book collaboration with her son, Slade, she offers a humorous look at how children experience meanness and anger in our world. The world and its language can be confusing to young people. To them, meanness can have many shapes, sizes, and sounds. &#34; My mother is mean when she says I don&#39;t listen. She says, &#34;Do you hear me?&#34; I can&#39;t hear her when she is screaming. This wise child knows that meanness can be a whisper or a shout, a smile or a frown. Young readers know about meanness, too, and will feel satisfied by having their perspective championed in The Book of Mean People.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winner Toni Morrison returns with her son Slade for a second kids' book, this one a catalog of the "mean people" in a young rabbit's life. The results, happily, make for much more fun than the Morrison duo's weirdly subtle <i>The Big Box</i>.<p> "This is a book about mean people," begins our tiny hero, and almost immediately we realize that illustrator Pascal Lema�tre is going to give cartoonist Matt Groening a run for his money when it comes to goofily rendered rabbits. Each "mean" person gets playful, exaggerated, kid-perspective treatment from Lema�tre, whether we're seeing a towering dad who barely fits onto two pages ("Some mean people are big") or a mother who's using her nearly telescopic arm to force veggies down our hero's throat ("There are people who smile when they are being mean"). The rabbit's "Mean People" book gets assembled page by page, and no one is spared--not grandparents, brothers, teachers, not even a babysitter with an alarm clock five times the size of her head.</p><p> The Morrisons maintain some of their <i>Big Box</i> subtlety by begging the question--of both kids <i>and</i> grownups--of why and whether and which of these people are really "mean" at all. (Even young kids will see the difference between making somebody get out of bed in the morning and tearing the wings off a butterfly.) Whatever the lesson, <i>The Book of Mean People</i> ends inevitably, triumphantly--"I will smile anyway!"--with a joyous, naked plunge into a flowery forest. ("How about that!")

Adrenaline pumped, mixing with excitement and nerves. I jumped up and down in place trying to shake the butterflies out of my stomach. It didn&#x2019;t work. I could hear my teammate Adam Vinatieri&#x2019;s advice from the week before ringing in my ears. &#x201c;Keep calm. Focus. And don&#x2019;t you dare blink at kickoff.&#x201d; The guy already had three championship rings and kicked the Super Bowl&#x2013;winning field goal as time expired not once but twice, so I knew I needed to listen to him. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x2019;t help but get caught up in the moment as I stood in the tunnel leading out onto the field, waiting to run out for Super Bowl XLI, the ultimate game I&#x2019;d dreamed about my entire life.<br> <br>The week leading up to the game felt surreal. The team flew down to Miami for the game the previous Sunday. On Monday we spent a couple of hours out on the Sun Life Stadium field for media day, which is more like a media circus. I remember standing out there, talking to my buddy Bryan Fletcher, when all of the sudden a horn sounded and people came pouring out of the stadium gates like ants and descended on us. Besides reporters from the usual media outlets like ESPN and Sports Illustrated, there were people there from every publication and website on earth, most of which had nothing to do with football or sports. Some of the &#x201c;reporters&#x201d; came dressed in outrageous costumes. It was nuts.<br> <br>And then the real craziness began.<br> <br>During Super Bowl week we practiced at the Miami Dolphins&#x2019; training facility. Whenever we traveled from the team hotel to the practice facility, Florida state troopers shut down the highway for our team buses. Cars had to pull over on the shoulder while police cars also blocked entrance ramps. Our buses drove down the middle of the five-lane highway like we owned the road. We weren&#x2019;t a football team. We were royalty. The royal treatment carried over to the practice field. Celebrities crowded around the field to watch us. Sometimes it was hard to concentrate on what we were there for, especially when Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe watched whether or not I caught the pass just thrown to me. He was the gold standard for tight ends, which is what I played on offense.<br> <br>After another royal ride down the freeway we returned to our hotel rooms, where we all found gift bags with the Super Bowl logo on the outside, bags loaded down with new iPods and clothes and hats and all sorts of cool memorabilia. The week felt more like a really nice vacation instead of the buildup to a championship game.<br> <br>In spite of the distractions, we had a great week of practice. The team felt really confident going into the game against the Chicago Bears. Just to get to the Super Bowl we had to beat the team that had won three of the previous five championships, and to do that we put together the biggest comeback in AFC Championship history. Every Colts player knew that if we played in the Super Bowl like we did in the second half of the AFC Championship, we had a good chance of becoming world champions.<br> <br>I, too, felt confident when Super Bowl Sunday finally rolled around. I&#x2019;d had a couple of nagging injuries I had to deal with toward the end of the season, but having two weeks between the AFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl gave me time to heal.<br> <br>On the day of the game I woke up early, since I couldn&#x2019;t really sleep anyway, and looked out the window to see a dark, overcast sky. It rained off and on most of the day. Never before had weather affected the Super Bowl, but the forecast said this was going to be the first. I didn&#x2019;t really care. We&#x2019;d played in worse conditions and won. I went downstairs for breakfast and sat through one meeting with the tight ends and another with the offensive linemen. After that I had nothing to do but sit around and watch movies and stare at the clock. Finally, around 2:00 p.m. I climbed on the team bus for the ride to the stadium. Of course, we had another police escort down a blocked-off freeway.<br> <br>I thought I was keyed up as I got dressed in the locker room, but nothing compared to what I felt standing in the tunnel waiting to go out onto the field for the first time. The game wasn&#x2019;t due to start for at least an hour, but the stadium was already starting to fill. Music blared in the stadium and blasted through the tunnel where I stood with our punter, Hunter Smith; kicker Adam Vinatieri; and our starting long snapper, Justin Snow. I backed up Justin. The four of us were going to go out on the field to warm up. Justin and I just looked at each other with smiles filled with joy and anxiousness. &#x201c;Can you believe we&#x2019;re here?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, it&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; Justin replied.<br> <br>Finally a stadium attendant looked up from a clipboard and said, &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;re set. Go.&#x201d; Hunter, Adam, Justin, and I all huddled close, gave the traditional embrace, then turned to go.<br> <br>I trotted down the tunnel toward the field. The sound of cleats on the concrete ramp echoed all around me. I had just cleared the tunnel and put one foot on the turf when I heard one voice ring out over all the rest of the stadium noise. &#x201c;Ben! Ben!&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked back over my shoulder and spotted my dad in his Colts rain jacket and ball cap leaning onto the railing just above the tunnel. He had a big smile on his face. &#x201c;Benjamin!&#x201d; he yelled again, waving his hand down toward me. I didn&#x2019;t know how he was able to work his way through the crowd over to this spot. He and my mom and the rest of our family had seats on the other side of the field. &#x201c;Ben, up here!&#x201d; he said again.<br> <br>I raised my hand to acknowledge I&#x2019;d heard him, and to get him to stop calling my name. Then I sort of flicked my hand with a dismissive wave like I was trying to shoo off a pesky fly. All I could think was, Not now, Dad. Don&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m working? Don&#x2019;t you understand I am about to go out on the field for the biggest game of my life on the biggest stage in the world?! After waving my dad off, I turned back toward the field and started to run out onto the turf.<br> <br>But a voice in my head stopped me in my tracks. From deep inside I heard my father calling to me, not in the stadium, but in my backyard.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>My mind took me back to a day when I felt the same mix of adrenaline, nerves, and excitement as I walked out on the freshly cut grass, my brand-new cleats laced up tight. &#x201c;Ready, Ben?&#x201d; my dad asked then. I nodded my head, bent over, and planted my hand in the turf as I got in a three-point stance. Tiny beads of sweat gathered on my brow; my legs shook in anticipation. I was like a spring, wound up tight, just waiting to go off. Suddenly the football moved. &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; my dad said. I took off like a bullet. Legs churning, head down, I lowered my shoulders, closed my eyes, and lunged with all my might into the man with the football. I landed right in the middle of my dad&#x2019;s chest. He fell backward from his knees and wrapped his arms around my four-year-old body. &#x201c;Good job, Ben,&#x201d; he said as he lifted me up, a huge grin on his face. &#x201c;Want to try it again?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t even answer. I just raced back over to where I started and got back down in a three-point stance, ready to go.<br> <br>From the back porch I heard my mom clapping like I&#x2019;d just made the game-winning tackle in the Super Bowl. &#x201c;Way to go, Beno-Button,&#x201d; she called out. &#x201c;And be careful,&#x201d; she had to add because she&#x2019;s my mom. Then she called over to my dad, &#x201c;Jeff, you take it easy on him.&#x201d;<br> <br>My dad just smiled and nodded. &#x201c;Okay, Lori,&#x201d; he said while giving me a little wink. &#x201c;All right, Ben, let&#x2019;s do it again,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I also heard my dad&#x2019;s voice call my name a few years later when my hands were big enough to catch a football. &#x201c;Go long, Ben,&#x201d; he said, motioning with his left arm and winding up the football with his right. The backyard of the parsonage where we lived wasn&#x2019;t big enough for me to run real pass routes. Instead my dad went across the street from our corner lot and had me stand on the curb right in front of our house. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, go long.&#x201d; I took off running down the side of our lot, right up next to the six-foot-tall cedar fence that surrounded the property. For a preacher, my dad had a really good arm. He lofted a spiral in my direction. I scrambled to get under it, moving right up next to the fence. Most of the time I caught the ball. Sometimes I smashed into the fence. There were times I did both. But catching the ball up against a tall fence was really good practice for me. I got used to grabbing the ball out of the air in tight places, even when that meant the catch was followed by a collision.<br> <br>After I made the catch I took off running toward the make-believe end zone at the end of the fence line. Then I quickly sprinted back toward my dad. If there weren&#x2019;t any cars coming, I stopped at the curb and threw the ball across the street to him. &#x201c;Nice catch, Ben. Good hands. Ready to do it again?&#x201d; I always was. And my dad&#x2019;s arm never seemed to get tired. He&#x2019;d stay outside throwing passes to me as long as I wanted. I loved the game. He loved spending time with me. It took me a while to figure out that that&#x2019;s what I loved about the game as well. Football meant time with my dad.<br> <br>I still heard my father&#x2019;s voice calling my name when I signed up for my first real full-contact football team, right after my family moved to a new town. My father is a Methodist pastor. The Methodist church moves their ministers every five to ten years. Right before the start of my sixth-grade year it was our turn to go. We left the little town of Lindstrom, Minnesota, a place where everyone knows everyone else, to go to the historic Mississippi River town of Hastings, Minnesota. Hastings was ten times bigger than Lindstrom, but it was still basically a small town. I worried about fitting in and being accepted there. My mom and dad told me not to worry, that everything was going to be okay, but I wasn&#x2019;t so sure.<br> <br>I joined my first football team and had gone through a few weeks of practice, but I still didn&#x2019;t really know anyone. Most everyone already seemed to have their circle of friends. Breaking into social circles can be tough in small towns. On top of that, I had a late birthday, which meant I was a year younger than most of my classmates all the way through college.<br> <br>I may have been younger than most of the other sixth graders, but I was one of the biggest guys on my team. The coach had me play end on defense and wide receiver on offense. On the first play of the first game of my life, I lined up on defense directly across from the offensive tackle, just as the coach had shown me. I leaned over, planted my fingers in the grass in a three-point stance, and dug in my cleats. My dad stood on the sideline next to one of the coaches. Like me, my dad didn&#x2019;t yet know anyone in town.<br> <br>The quarterback barked off the signals. I looked up and down the offensive line and saw a huge gap between the tackle and the guard. Why am I lined up directly across from this guy where he can easily block me when I could jump the gap and avoid him? I wondered. Before the ball could snap, I jumped over into the gap. The moment the center moved the ball I fired off the line as fast as I could and headed straight toward the quarterback. I got to the quarterback as he was about to hand the ball off to the running back. I grabbed the ball out of his hand and took off running down the field. As I ran toward the end zone my dad yelled from the sidelines, &#x201c;Run, Ben! Run, son!&#x201d; No one came close to me as I trotted across the goal line, untouched, to score my first touchdown.<br> <br>The coach standing next to my dad turned to him as I crossed the goal line. &#x201c;That kid, now that&#x2019;s an athlete,&#x201d; he said. Then he introduced himself to my father. I didn&#x2019;t have to worry about fitting in any longer.<br> <br>After I started playing organized football my dad and I still tossed the football around the backyard, but more and more he watched as I played. After Little Raiders football came junior high, then high school. My dad and my mom were always on the sidelines or up in the stands. When I went off to college they came to as many games as they could, but they had to watch all the road games on television or listen on the radio. After the Indianapolis Colts signed me to a free agent contract out of college, my dad went down to the local Irish sports bar and grill and made an arrangement with the owner. &#x201c;My son plays for the Colts, but the local stations don&#x2019;t show many of their games,&#x201d; my dad explained to him. &#x201c;Do you think you could have one of your televisions show the Colts game so we can watch?&#x201d; The owner could not turn him down.<br> <br>Through my first year playing for the Colts my dad and mom went straight from my dad&#x2019;s church to the Irish bar and grill every Sunday. When we played early games that started at noon Minnesota time they sometimes missed part of the first quarter. In my second year my dad bought the NFL cable package so he could watch, and DVR, the Colts&#x2019; games at home. They came to games in Indy when they could. They were in the stands in the RCA Dome when we beat the New England Patriots in a miracle comeback to advance to the Super Bowl. Of course they were here, in Miami, for the biggest game of my life.<br> <br>And I had just blown my dad off when he tried to share a moment with me before the Super Bowl. I felt sick to my stomach. I could not take another step. Me playing in this game wasn&#x2019;t just my dream. It was his as well. Go back to where it all started, came to me in a gentle whisper. Go back to where it all started. I knew right then that in this moment the biggest game of my life was not the most important thing. I turned around and scanned the stands for my father. He&#x2019;d left the railing and started walking back to his seat. I caught sight of him just up the ramp a little ways. &#x201c;Dad! Dad!&#x201d; I called out to him.<br> <br>He stopped and turned.<br> <br>I waved for him to come back down to where he had been a few moments earlier. He came back to the rail. I reached up my hand as high as I could as he reached down to me. I grabbed his hand tight. Tears filled my eyes. &#x201c;It all started in the backyard with you, Dad. I love you. Thank you so much,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>My dad smiled. &#x201c;I love you, too.&#x201d; We were in the backyard again, playing football, my mom cheering me on from the porch. It was as if no one else were there, just the two of us.<br> <br>The sound of the crowd returned. I had to go. I let go of my dad&#x2019;s hand and ran out onto the field with my teammates. The game started with a huge play by the Bears and ended with our team holding the Lombardi Trophy as world champions. The Super Bowl was all I imagined it to be. Yet I came away from the game reflecting on how I almost lost something irreplaceable before the game even started. Standing in the tunnel, caught up in the hype and excitement of the Super Bowl, I nearly let the game consume me. I almost lost myself, my real identity, all because of a game.<br> <br>I now look back on that moment with a sense of irony. Even though I made a conscious choice to go back to where it all began for me and there recover my true self, I now face a battle in which I may not have a choice in how this ends. The game has already changed me in ways from which I may never recover. Future changes could well lie in front of me. The odds are troubling. In all fairness, it is not the game of football in and of itself that extracted such a heavy toll on me, but rather the lasting results of what medical books call mild traumatic brain injury. Most people simply call them concussions. I suffered five documented concussions over the course of my playing career, ...</p><h2>The Official Rules of Baseball Illustrated</h2><p>The entertaining story of the rules' evolution.<br></p><p>In The Official Rules of Baseball Illustrated, David Nemec relates the history of the rules, explores how the rules have changed and why, and relates some of the most memorable episodes in baseball in which the rules have played a central role: the famed Pine Tar Game,&#x201d; the beaning of Ray Chapman, and many more.

She lives in New York City.</p>Hippocrates said, "Let food be your medicine, and medicine be your food." Root, an orthopedic surgeon, agrees with this advice and presents compelling evidence as to why it's true. Osteoporosis, often called "the silent killer," affects both men and women. And it's common: "more than twice as many Americans die from complications resulting from hip fractures [due to osteoporosis] than from car accident fatalities." Root describes the disease and offers illustrations to emphasize its impact on the body. He explains who is at risk and why and includes ways to reduce risk factors. Although osteoporosis is commonly considered "a little old lady's disease," the author points out that the average American woman now lives at least one-third of her life after menopause. Thus, she'd be wise to prepare for that stage of life. This is a practical, how-to book that lists the new bone-building medications available and provides readers with a 14-day, healthy, high-calcium diet; a seven-day, healthy, high-calcium diet for vegetarians; and one for the lactose-intolerant as well. Part three reminds readers that "bones need exercise like babies need love," and affords an illustrated exercise regime as well as a chapter on the safest aerobic and alternative therapies. The coup de grace is the cookbook at book's end. With recipes for The Famous French Croque-Monsieur Sandwich and Macaroni and Cheese, calcium never looked so good. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Zimmer traces <i>E. coli</i>'s remarkable history, showing how scientists used it to discover how genes work and then to launch the entire biotechnology industry. While some strains of <i>E. coli</i> grab headlines by causing deadly diseases, scientists are retooling the bacteria to produce everything from human insulin to jet fuel. <br><br><i>Microcosm </i>is the story of the one species on Earth that science knows best of all. It's also a story of life itself--of its rules, its mysteries, and its future.</p><p>In 1946, a 20 year old medical school student called Joshua Lederberg decided to find out whether microbes make love. Lederbeter was motivated not by a displaced libido, but by scientific ambition. At the age of seven, he had declared that he hoped to become 'like Einstein' and to 'discover a few things in science.' <p>The 'few things' Lederberg discovered would revolutionise modern science and earn him a Nobel Prize. He chose to observe the breeding habits of a certain bacterium called Escherichia coli, better known as E coli. His experiments used defective E coli strains lacking the essential molecules to reproduce by cloning which should, by rights, perish in the petri dish. But slowly, a few colonies of survivors began to spread accross the dishes. The only possible explanation for their survival was that they were a product of sex. Not only had Lederberg proved that bacteria have sex, he had also proved they have genes. </p> <p>Since then, what was once nothing more than a humble resident of the human gut has become our best guide to what it means to be alive. Most of us might only know E coli for its lethal strain that causes food poisoning. Zimmer uses E coli as a prism to understand what life is, what it was, and what it will become. Among other things, Zimmer tells us how E coli microbes talk to each other, how studies of their evolution represent the most powerful evidence in support of natural selection, and how they might just explain life on other planets...</p>Praise for Carl Zimmer's Soul Made Flesh <p>'The fascinating story of how people first became aware of one the most radical thoughts the human mind has ever had to think.

Teddy was looking outside to see if the weather was good enough.<br> Good enough meant: Not raining.<br> Not good enough meant: Raining. Because if it was raining he had to stay inside, stay dry, and not go outside to see what might have happened in the darkness of night, when he was inside, sleeping.&nbsp;<br> That morning, the weather was good enough.<br> The night&#x2019;s wind had blown itself out of the sky and dragged all the clouds after. Now a yellow sun floated just over the horizon. Teddy looked out his window at the big old beech tree and the low hill behind it, where four tall pines pointed up into the sky like spears, or candles on a birthday cake. Teddy looked out his window at the new day.<br> From his window, everything seemed the same today as yesterday, but what if it wasn&#x2019;t?<br> &#x201c;Umpah?&#x201d; he called.<br> A soft gray elephant came into the room, accompanied by the sweet smells of good things baking in the oven. &#x201c;Good morning, Teddy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made peach muffins.&#x201d;<br> Teddy wasn&#x2019;t thinking about muffins. He was thinking about all the things that might happen in a night. &#x201c;What if we slept outside?&#x201d; he wondered.<br> &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t want to do that,&#x201d; said Umpah. &#x201c;There would be no roof, no windows and doors to close against cold and rain. There would be no protection from the kind of wind that was blowing last night. Didn&#x2019;t you hear it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care about those things,&#x201d; Teddy answered, even though he knew Umpah had the right of it.<br> &#x201c;Houses are warmer and safer than outside. So are burrows, and caves.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re called shelter,&#x201d; Teddy said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what <i>shelter </i>means. But still, things happen at night, outside, all night long.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Things also happen all <i>day </i>long,&#x201d; Umpah argued. &#x201c;Daytime things. We go out during the day and we stay inside at night.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But why?&#x201d; asked Teddy.<br> &#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s the comfortable way,&#x201d; Umpah explained. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother yourself thinking about it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no bother,&#x201d; Teddy said.<br> Umpah waited another pair of minutes, in case Teddy needed something else explained to him. But Teddy just stared out the window, so Umpah went back to his baking. He had no desire to sleep outside, even if there was bright moonlight and no wind. He didn&#x2019;t want Teddy sleeping outside either, alone, all night long. Just for one thing, what if he was frightened and Umpah was sound asleep and didn&#x2019;t hear him call? Or what if it suddenly started to rain, for another? How would Teddy get inside? He couldn&#x2019;t make his wagon move by himself.&nbsp;<br> Umpah took a damp cloth to clean the flour from the countertop.<br> Teddy looked out the window and tried <i>not </i>to wonder what it might be like to sleep outside, among the mysterious shadows that moonlight casts when it falls through the wide, leafy branches of a beech tree, under a sky so filled with stars that there is almost no room for black empty spaces between them. Then he saw Sid&#x2019;s pointed nose sticking out from his burrow under the beech tree roots.<br> Some nights, Teddy knew, Sid wrapped his long, striped body around one of the branches and slept outside. But Teddy couldn&#x2019;t do that. He didn&#x2019;t have Sid&#x2019;s long, thin shape, good for wrapping around branches. He was a brown ball of a bear. He had a furry round brown head with bright button eyes, a short brown snout and little brown ears. He had no neck and stubby arms, a round brown belly, and he had lost his legs a long time ago. He knew he would fall right off any branch and plop down onto the ground.<br> Sid slipped out of his burrow and slid along the path to Teddy&#x2019;s house. He saw Teddy, but he was heading for muffins and had no time to say Good Morning. He had no time to knock, either. He slid right in through the door and went to the kitchen. Teddy heard Umpah say &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got peach muffins.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> He heard Sid say &#x201c;I especially like peach muffins,&#x201d; and then he thought he could hear the sound of muffins being swallowed whole, one after another, one muffin, two, three, four muffins, five.<br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Sid. &#x201c;Thank you, Umpah. I feel better.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did you feel bad?&#x201d; asked Umpah. &#x201c;Are you sick?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I was only empty and now I&#x2019;m full. Can Teddy come out?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes of course,&#x201d; Umpah said. He pulled Teddy&#x2019;s wagon out into the front yard and returned to his baking.<br> When it was only Teddy and Sid and no Umpah, Sid moved the handle of the red wagon to where Teddy&#x2019;s arms could reach it, then slithered around behind to put his head against the back and get it moving. Teddy steered by pushing against the handle. He pushed with his right arm to turn left and he pushed with his left arm to turn right and Sid pushed from behind and it all worked pretty well.<br> They went down the dirt path to the sandy beach, to see what the nighttime tide had carried in. That day, it was only a dead pine branch and some eelgrass. Sid looked, but there was nothing to eat hidden among the long black wet grasses, so he slithered back to Teddy and Umpah&#x2019;s red house and had a two-muffin snack.<br> Alone on the beach, Teddy counted the waves as they rolled gently to shore, nibbling at the sand. The tide was going out and&nbsp;those waves gave him an idea to wonder about. He wondered if fewer waves came up to the shore when the tide was going out than when it was coming in. So as soon as Sid returned, he said, &#x201c;When I say Go<i>, </i>turn around to face the beech tree and start counting to one hundred. I&#x2019;ll count how many waves come in during that time. Then, when the tide is coming in this afternoon, I can count again while you count again too. Ready,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;get set&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to count to one hundred,&#x201d; Sid said. &#x201c;Can I count to twenty? I know how to count to twenty.&#x201d;<br> Teddy thought. &#x201c;Can you count to twenty two times?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Two times, one right after the other? And no rushing.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I <i>can </i>do that,&#x201d; said Sid. &#x201c;I think,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Will it take long? Because what if I get hungry?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not very long,&#x201d; Teddy promised. &#x201c;Are you ready? Ready, get set, go!&#x201d;<br> Teddy began to count very quietly, noticing every little wave that came creeping shyly up toward his wagon.<br> When Sid cried &#x201c;Twenty! Twice!&#x201d; Teddy stopped counting and memorized the number he&#x2019;d reached, which was twenty-six.<br> After that they watched seagulls taking naps on top of the water.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Undivided Past: Humanity Beyond Our Differences</h2><p><p><b>From one of our most acclaimed historians, a wise and provocative call to re-examine the way we look at the past: not merely as the story of incessant conflict between groups but also of human solidarity throughout the ages. <br></b><br> Investigating the six most salient categories of human identity, difference, and confrontation&#x2014;religion,&nbsp;nation, class, gender, race, and civilization&#x2014;David Cannadine questions just how determinative&nbsp;each of them has really been. For while each has motivated people dramatically at particular moments, they have rarely been as pervasive, as divisive, or as important as is suggested by such simplified polarities as &#x201c;us versus them,&#x201d; &#x201c;black versus white,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the clash of civilizations.&#x201d; For most of recorded time, these identities have been more fluid and these differences less unbridgeable than political leaders, media commentators&#x2014;and some historians&#x2014;would have us believe. Throughout history, in fact, fruitful conversations have continually taken place across these allegedly impermeable boundaries of identity: the world, as Cannadine shows, has never been simply and starkly divided between any two adversarial solidarities but always an interplay of overlapping constituencies.<br><br> Yet our public discourse is polarized more than ever around the same simplistic divisions, and Manichean narrative has become the default mode to explain everything that is happening in the world today. With wide-ranging erudition, David Cannadine compellingly argues against the pervasive and pernicious idea that conflict is the inevitable state of human affairs. <i>The</i> <i>Undivided Past</i> is an urgently needed work of history, one that is also about the present&#x2014;and the future.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Sir David Cannadine was born in Birmingham, England, in 1950 and educated at Cambridge, Oxford, and Princeton. He is the author of many acclaimed books, including&nbsp;<i>The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy,&nbsp;G. M. Trevelyan,</i>&nbsp;<i>History in Our Time, Class in Britain, Ornamentalism, </i>and <i>Mellon</i>. He has taught at Cambridge and Columbia Universities and has also served as director of the Institute of Historical Research, University of London. He is currently Dodge Professor of History at Princeton University.<br></p>When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and you knew exactly who they were. It was &#x201c;us versus them,&#x201d; and it was clear who them [sic] was. Today, we&#x2019;re not so sure who they are, but we know they&#x2019;re there.<br> &#x2014;President George W. Bush, quoted in the <i>New York Times</i>, April 16, 2006<br> &nbsp;<br> The world is awash in divisions rooted in the human compulsion to believe our differences are more important than our common humanity . . . .[But] our common humanity is more important than our interesting and inevitable differences.<br> &#x2014;President Bill Clinton, <i>Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World<br></i> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This book sets out to explore and investigate the most resonant forms of human solidarity as they have been invented and created, established and sustained, questioned and denied, fissured and broken across the centuries and around the world, and as they have defined the lives, engaged the emotions, and influenced the fates of countless millions of individuals. It does so by looking at the six most commonplace and compelling forms of such identities, namely religion, nation, class, gender, race, and civilization. Sometimes regional, sometimes national, and sometimes more global in their compass and in the claims made on their behalf, these groupings have commanded widespread allegiance and commitment, on occasions for good, but often not, since every collective solidarity simultaneously creates an actual or potential antagonist out of the group or groups it excludes.&nbsp;Even if we confine ourselves to the twentieth century, there have been many such confrontations and conflicts variously described as religious wars, or national wars, or class wars, or gender wars, or race wars, or wars for civilization. And whatever the solidarity ties specific to our own time, analogous groupings and analogous conflicts have existed across the millennia and around the world, from Christians versus pagans during the later Roman Empire to the white supremacists versus anti- apartheid campaigners until 1994; and there is no reason to suppose that the twenty- first century will be free of such confrontations. As a consequence, it has come to seem almost axiomatic that the best way to understand past worlds, as well as present circumstances and our future prospects, is in the workings and outcomes of latent or actual conflicts between antagonistic identities, or of how things go in the great game of &#x201c;us versus them,&#x201d; exemplified in the words of President George W. Bush quoted above.1<br> &nbsp;<br> What is perhaps most remarkable is how well the appeal of &#x201c;us versus them&#x201d; works over a range of categories, aggregations, and identities that are scarcely comparable. For much of recorded history the two most prominent have been (initially) religious affiliation and (subsequently) national allegiance. It is only in relatively recent times that they have been augmented, and in some measure superseded, by the secular, international trinity of class consciousness, gender awareness, and racial solidarity. And since the events of September 11, 2001, the even larger identity and more capacious category of civilization, earlier invoked by historians from Edward Gibbon to Arnold Toynbee, has made a comeback, embodied in the writings of Samuel P. Huntington, which were subsequently invoked by his neoconservative followers in the United States and by his New Labour admirers in the&nbsp;United Kingdom. But the fact remains that each of these solidarities is constituted around a distinctive axis of interest and awareness: religious cohesion is an expression of faith and belief (or, depending on one&#x2019;s sympathies, of superstition and irrationality), and can be as much concerned with the next world as with this; national identity relies on a shared narrated memory and sense of geographical belonging, reinforced by a common language and culture and state power; class consciousness is seen as the outcome of the different relations of people to the modes of production, leading to the hostile solidarities of workers and employers; gender and race identities are partly the result of biology, but also of the meanings and antagonisms constructed and projected onto anatomical features shared by some human beings but not by others; while civilization is perhaps the most flexible form of human grouping, which can be defined according to any number of criteria. Yet however disparate and incommensurable, these collective identities have all been defined and reinforced through confrontation, struggle, and conflict&#x2014; against an alternative religion, an enemy nation, a hostile class, the other gender, a different race, or an alien civilization. The result has been the serial reiteration of the Manichean view that the world is divided into conflicting groups, with a monolithic &#x201c;good&#x201d; on one side (those with &#x201c;us&#x201d;), and a no less monolithic &#x201c;evil&#x201d; on the other (those against &#x201c;us&#x201d;). This ultimately apocalyptic perspective has resonated on many terrible occasions throughout history, and it was vigorously and unapologetically reiterated by President George W. Bush in his final address from the Oval Office: &#x201c;I have spoken to you often,&#x201d; he told his fellow Americans, &#x201c;about good and evil, and this has made some people uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can be no compromise.&#x201d;2 The trouble is, whether good and evil exist as such, the absolutes they imply have been ascribed with various degrees of literalism to every manner of perceived difference. And so a battle of cosmic significance might be claimed between Protestant and Catholic, America and Russia, employee and employer, women and men, black and white, or &#x201c;the West&#x201d; and Islam, confrontations in which each side seeks to galvanize its supporters by exaggerating their solidarity and virtue, and by imputing to the other side a no less exaggerated solidarity and wickedness.3 This impulse thus to sunder all the peoples of the world into belligerent collectivities has existed as long as humanity itself, and in our own day the easy recourse to such polarized thinking by many political leaders and public figures, and by pundits and commentators, is further exaggerated by an increasingly strident media. It has also been underscored by some historians who have been more concerned to legitimate the claims and urge the merits of one collective identity over and against any (or all) others than to take a broader view of the human past.4<br> &nbsp;<br> During the last half century or so, the conventional wisdom that &#x201c;the history of humanity is based upon the immemorial divisions of its peoples&#x201d; has been reinforced by a growing academic insistence on the importance of recognizing the &#x201c;difference&#x201d; between collective groups.5 According to the anthropologist Clifford Geertz, &#x201c;difference is what makes the world go round, especially the political world&#x201d;; many of his colleagues as well as literary scholars and cultural critics would agree, and so do those historians who have focused their attention on the creation, perception, working, meaning, and significance of what they varyingly describe as &#x201c;difference,&#x201d; or &#x201c;otherness,&#x201d; or &#x201c;alterity,&#x201d; or &#x201c;unlikeness,&#x201d; or &#x201c;dissimilarity.&#x201d;6 Beyond doubt, such historical approaches have yielded significant work of enduring value, illuminating dimensions of human experience once unexamined; but as William H. McNeill, one of the pioneers of global history, has pointed out, the academic preoccupation with the binary simplicities of difference, and with the antagonisms based on them, results in a version of &#x201c;the past as we want it to be, safely simplified into a contest between good guys and bad guys, &#x2018;us and them,&#x2019; &#x201d; which disconcertingly resembles the polarized, apocalyptic perspective of President George W. Bush&#x2014; or, indeed, of the late Osama bin Laden.7<br> &nbsp;<br> But the fact that humanity is still here, that no one has vanquished &#x201c;us&#x201d; or &#x201c;them&#x201d; on either side of any of these divides, despite such &#x201c;ultimate&#x201d; confrontations and conflicts, suggests that there is a case for taking a broader, more ecumenical, and even more optimistic view of human identities and relations&#x2014;a view that not only accepts difference and conflict based on clashing sectional identities, but also recognizes affinities and discerns conversations across these allegedly impermeable boundaries of identity, which embody and express a broader sense of humanity that goes beyond our dis-similarities.8 This alternative perspective is well put by the poet and civil rights activist Maya&nbsp;Angelou:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>I note the obvious differences</i><br> <i>Between each sort and type,</i><br> <i>But we are more alike, my friends,</i><br> <i>Than we are unalike.</i><b><i>9</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> In the same vein, if more prosaically, the historian Timothy Garton Ash has deplored the &#x201c;Manichean cultural dichotomies&#x201d; that are peddled by a partisan media, at the expense of the alternative conversation &#x201c;about what all human beings have in common&#x201d;; and Neil MacGregor, the director of the British Museum, has lamented the &#x201c;brutally over- simplified notions of identity&#x201d; that &#x201c;sustain entrenched conflicts,&#x201d; when in reality, cultures constantly &#x201c;overlap, borrow from each other and live together&#x201d; in &#x201c;a conversation with the whole of humanity.&#x201d;10 Hence the second epigraph to this introduction, in which President Clinton urges us to see humanity in less paranoid and more imaginative ways than the exaggerated polarities embraced by his successor in the&nbsp;White House.11<br> &nbsp;<br> In his recent book, appropriately entitled The Fear of Barbarians, the Franco- Bulgarian philosopher Tzvetan Todorov puts this point emphatically: &#x201c;the facile dichotomies between Light and Darkness, free world and obscurantism, sweet tolerance and blind violence, tell us more about the overweening pride of their authors than the complexity of the contemporary world.&#x201d; &#x201c;No merit,&#x201d; he goes on, in words that might be an explicit riposte to President George W. Bush, &#x201c;lies in preferring good to evil when we ourselves define the meaning of these two words.&#x201d;12 But most of the academic writing that is skeptical of these Manichean ways of seeing the world, and which urges the broader claims of our common humanity, has been produced by scholars whose interests are philosophical rather than historical, and who are concerned with the present and the recent past rather than with more distant epochs.13 This book, by contrast, seeks to address these issues from a longer- term historical perspective: by examining each of these six collective identities over substantial periods of time; by drawing attention to the excessive and inaccurate claims that have invariably been made for them in terms of their unity, homogeneity, and shared consciousness; and by investigating the conversations and interactions that have gone on across the boundaries of these allegedly impermeable identities, in the sustained and successful pursuit of a more sympathetic vision of a shared humanity. Like Todorov, I argue that the unrelenting insistence on seeing the world in Manichean terms is at best partial and divisive, at worst reductive and misleading: for these very categories of &#x201c;us&#x201d; and &#x201c;them,&#x201d; whatever their particular articulation, and though proclaimed to be irreducible and absolute, frequently reveal themselves to be unstable and ambiguous; they often prove to be incoherent even in the thick of their confrontations with the implacable foe; and they are held together not so much by shared self- awareness as by the exhortations of leaders, journalists, activists&#x2014; and by some historians, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book addresses these issues, by investigating each of those six divisive collective identities with which we seem most preoccupied, even while acknowledging and demonstrating that they are in some ways very different sorts of solidarities. For they are sufficiently similar to one another in their polarizing propensities to merit an urgently needed comparative analysis that is evenhandedly skeptical of each and of all their claims to priority and supremacy. Accordingly, the following chapters examine how theologians and priests, politicians and pundits, commentators and historians have each asserted the incomparable importance of one particular form of collective human identity over any other, and how in so doing they have encouraged among those on one side of any divide a sense of the ultimate righteousness of their cause and collectivity. I go on to describe how, on occasion, people have indeed behaved in accordance with these Manichean analyses and prescriptions, in terms of religious fervor, national patriotism, class consciousness, gender awareness, racial solidarity, and civilizational identity. And I note how historians frequently contributed to this identity- obsessed way of seeing the world, most fully in the chapter on class. But I also look at the many conversations that have gone on in denial and defiance of these allegedly impermeable boundaries and antagonistic solidarities, which are too often presented, either mistakenly or mischievously, as if they are the only version of the human condition that has any salience or plausibility. For as individuals, we often recognize the common humanity that we lose sight of when called upon to act in groups.<br> &nbsp;<br> To tackle such a large, important, and controversial subject over such a long- term and broad range is, nevertheless, to run serious risks. For one thing, the collectivities and confrontations based on religion, nation, class, gender, race, and civilization stir powerful passions on the part of politicians, pundits, and the public&#x2014; and also of many engaged academics. They want to believe the world is simple in form and easily understood, readily divided between a virtuous &#x201c;us&#x201d; and an evil &#x201c;them,&#x201d; and in their determined part in helping construct such adversarial identities, they have provided much of the intellectual underpinning for seeing the world in antagonistic, binary ways.14 Another difficulty is the scale and scope of this enterprise. Of each of these chapters it is reasonable to say that a lifetime&#x2019;s reading and research is insufficient to acquire even a halfway competent understanding of the subject matter involved; and the same may be said of many of the subsections, too. To this charge, I can but reply that the attempt to open up the subject, if only to encourage (or provoke) others to do it better, is worth incurring the accusation of overreach.15 A further objection might be that in this search for common humanity amid the ruins of what has mostly been portrayed as its divided past, more of the examples are taken from European history than from any other part of the world. But there are limits to any author&#x2019;s knowledge and range, and in any case, many (though not all) of the identities explored here did originate and have been most manifest in Europe, or in the nearby Middle East.&nbsp;It has rightly been observed that one of the prime justifications for studying and writing history is to free ourselves from the tyranny of present- day opinion, and these pages seek to contribute to that liberating endeavor by questioning the conventional wisdom of single- identity politics, the alleged uniformity of antagonistic groups, the widespread liking for polarized modes of thought, and the scholarly preoccupations with difference.

Paul's conflict with them thus arose over his understanding of the nature and purpose of ecstatic speech versus their understanding, which had been shaped primarily by Hellenistic enthusiastic religion. Christopher Forbes argues that this scholarly position is incorrect.<p>Through a careful examination of the Hellenistic evidence, Forbes shows that there are "no compelling parallels" between Christian glossolalia or prophecy and Hellenistic ecstatic religion. In light of his findings, Forbes then argues that any exegetical conclusions about 1 Corinthians 12�&#x2013;14 that take the former path of understanding need to be reexamined.</p></p><p>Christopher Forbes lectures in New Testament, Hellenistic history, and history of ideas at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, where he is also Vice President of the Society for the Study of Early Christianity.

Beagle</h2><p>When New York Times Bestselling writer Tad Williams described Peter S. Beagle as a 'bandit prince out to steal reader's hearts' he touched on a truth that readers have known for fifty years. Beagle, whose work has touched generations of readers around the world, has spun rich, romantic and very funny tales that have beguiled and enchanted readers of all ages.<br><br>Undeniably, his most famous work is the much loved classic, The Last Unicorn, which tells of unicorn who sets off on quest to discover whether she is the last of her kind, and of the people she meets on her journey. Never prolific, The Last Unicorn is one of only five novels Beagle has published since A Fine and Private Place appeared in 1960, and was followed by The Folk of the Air, The Innkeeper's Song, and Tamsin.<br><br>During the first forty years of his career Beagle also wrote a small handful, scarcely a dozen, short stories. Classics like 'Come Lady Death,' 'Lila and the Werewolf,' 'Julie's Unicorn,' 'Professor Gottesman and the Indian Rhinoceros,' and the tales that make up Giant Bones. And then, starting just five years ago, he turned his attention to short fiction in earnest, and produced a stunning array of new stories including the Hugo and Nebula Award winning follow up to The Last Unicorn, 'Two Hearts,' WSFA Small Press Award winner 'El Regalo,' and wonderful stories like the surrealist 'The Last and Only,' the haunting 'The Rabbi s Hobby' and others.<br><br>Mirror Kingdoms: The Best of Peter S. Beagle collects the very best of these stories, over 200,000 words worth, ranging across 45 years of his career from early stories to freshly minted tales that will surprise and amaze readers. It's a book which shows, more than any other, just how successful this bandit prince from the streets of New York has been at stealing our hearts and underscores how much we hope he ll keep on doing so.</p><p>Because Beagle, not editor Strahan, introduces this hefty tome, the reasons why these 18 tales are Beagle&#x2019;s best are never stated. How irksome for Beaglephiles, who know that he doesn&#x2019;t write mediocre, much less bad, stories. Five previous collections contribute all but four stories here, so maybe a reviewer will be most helpful characterizing the erstwhile fugitives. &#x201c;What Tune the Enchantress Plays&#x201d; is the irritable dramatic monologue, delivered to a demon, of a woman tricked out of the love of her life and her subsequent vengeance; it&#x2019;s utterly convincing, for Beagle catches precisely the voice of just such a not-in-this-world character. &#x201c;Vanishing&#x201d; is a ghost story about atonement and, just possibly, redemptive change by a man who let a moment of horror at the Berlin wall in 1963 ruin his life. The autobiographically tinted &#x201c;The Rock in the Park&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Rabbi&#x2019;s Hobby&#x201d; are about, respectively, a boy&#x2019;s run-ins with centaurs (in Central Park, yet) and the ghost of someone who never lived. They&#x2019;re superb and in superb company. --Ray OlsonStarred Review. Scientists may call the rhinoceros a unicorn, but only Beagle can make it feel like one. Facing reality&#x2014;often a magical reality hidden under mundane trappings&#x2014;is the key to understanding magical transformations and repairing damage, saving one time-traveling brother trapped in Thursday (El Regalo) and thwarting another who is the angel of death (We Never Talk about My Brother). Prosaic rabbis must deal with angels (Uncle Chaim and Aunt Rifke and the Angel) and ghosts (The Rabbi's Hobby) while supernatural daughters cope with mother issues (Lila the Werewolf, What Tune the Enchantress Plays). Two Hearts, the coda to <i>The Last Unicorn</i>, is a moving ode to heroism. Beagle plays on the heartstrings like a master musician, and this definitive collection, a magnificent grand tour of his many created worlds, will thrill his legions of fans. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Paul Wilson builds the concluding chapter of Repairman Jack: The Early Years, the prequel trilogy focusing on the formative years of Wilson's globally popular supernatural troubleshooter.</p><p>The strands of Jack's life, established in the first two books,<i> Cold City</i> and <i>Dark City</i>, are now woven into a complete pattern. </p><p>Centered around an obscure group of malcontents intent on creating a terrible explosion in New York City in 1993, <i>Fear City</i> shows the final stages of young Jack becoming Repairman Jack. It is a dark and terrible story, full of plots and needless mayhem, with secret agents, a freelance torturer, a secret society as old as human history, love, death, and a very bleak triumph. Jack threads his way through this intricate maze, as people he loves are stripped away from him in a way that presages the later epic series of novels. </p><p><b>This edition of the book is the deluxe, tall rack mass market paperback.</b></p></p><p><b>F. Paul Wilson</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of horror, adventure, medical thrillers, science fiction, and virtually everything in between. His books include the Repairman Jack novels&#x2015;including <i>Ground Zero</i>, <i>The Tomb</i>, and <i>Fatal Error</i>&#x2015;the Adversary cycle&#x2015;including <i>The Keep</i>&#x2015;and a young adult series featuring the teenage Jack.

He lives in Wall, New Jersey.<p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Is this the Shadow?&#x201d; Jack said, holding up the cellophane envelope. &#x201c;I mean, <i>the</i> Shadow?&#x201d;</p> <p>The sixtyish guy behind the counter&#x2014;lank hair, three-day stubble, ratty brown cardigan&#x2014;looked annoyed as he brought it close to his smeared glasses and squinted at the label. Jack wondered how he saw anything through them.</p> <p>&#x201c;If it says &#x2018;genuine glow in the dark Shadow ring,&#x2019; which it does, then that&#x2019;s what it is.&#x201d;</p> <p>Attracted by the BACK-DATE MAGAZINES sign, Jack had wandered into this narrow, coffin-sized store off Times Square. The place seemed to specialize in <i>Life</i> magazine and had moldy issues piled to the ceiling. Jack had been curious to see if the place stocked any old pulps. It did, but only a few, and those had disconcerting titles like <i>Ranch Romances</i> and <i>Fifteen Love Stories</i>. None of the <i>Black Mask</i> types he was hunting for. But tucked in among the yellowed, flaking issues he&#x2019;d found the ring.</p> <p>The white plastic body was shaped like the Shadow on each side&#x2014;Jack could even make out a .45 Colt semiauto in one hand&#x2014;but the stone set in the top was bright blue and shaped like Gibraltar.</p> <p>&#x201c;But this looks nothing like the Shadow&#x2019;s girasol ring.&#x201d;</p> <p>The guy stared at him. &#x201c;Do you even know what a girasol is?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fire opal.&#x201d;</p> <p>This seemed to take him by surprise. &#x201c;Okay. Point for you. What are you&#x2014;eighteen?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack didn&#x2019;t react. He got this all the time. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re half a dozen short.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Coulda fooled me. But still a kid. How does a twenty-four-year-old like you know about the Shadow&#x2019;s girasol ring?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Read a few old issues.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the pulp Shadow. The character started on radio, sponsored by a company called Blue Coal. That blue plastic &#x2018;stone&#x2019; there is supposed to be a chunk of blue coal.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack was thinking it was just about the neatest thing he&#x2019;d seen in a long time.</p> <p>&#x201c;And it glows in the dark too?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it says. Never tested it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Twenty bucks.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be a bargain next year after the movie comes out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What movie?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>The Shadow</i>. Gonna star Alec Baldwin, I hear.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack remembered him from <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>. Yeah, he had the look for the Lamont Cranston part.</p> <p>&#x201c;So if I&#x2019;m tired of it next year you&#x2019;ll buy it back for more?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t promise that. Can&#x2019;t even promise I&#x2019;ll be here, what with Disney moving in.&#x201d;</p> <p>News to Jack.</p> <p>&#x201c;Disney? Here?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Word is they&#x2019;re negotiating a ninety-nine-year lease on the Amsterdam.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Donald Duck on the Deuce? No way.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s scared shitless because it&#x2019;ll be proof that the Times Square cleanup every mayor since LaGuardia&#x2019;s been talking about is gonna happen, and you know what that means.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack pushed aside a vision of Minnie Mouse in hot pants saying, &#x201c;Hiya, sailor.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Rents through the roof. Guys like me forced out, moving over to Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen or farther downtown or just closing up and walking away.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, no! Where will people go for their copies of <i>Ranch Romances</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>His eyes narrowed behind the grimy lenses. &#x201c;You a wiseass?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack could see the guy was genuinely worried. He thought about boxing up and moving all those copies of <i>Life</i> and regretted the remark.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sometimes the mouth runs ahead of the brain.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;People get in trouble that way.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tell me about it.&#x201d;</p> <p>He forked over a Jackson. The guy slipped it into his pocket and didn&#x2019;t ask for sales tax. Fine.</p> <p>Jack walked out with his treasure and slipped it onto his pinky finger. He ambled east toward Times Square, thinking not of the Shadow but of Disney instead.</p> <p>What he remembered most about Disney World from the couple of times his folks had taken him there during the seventies was how clean it had been. Could that happen here? Times Square was anything but clean, and 42nd Street even less so. But grime and kitsch and porn and fringe people were part of the ambience. Take that away and replace it with a bunch of high-end chain stores and what did you have? You had a freaking mall. Might as well move back to Jersey.</p> <p>As he crossed Duffy Square and headed up Seventh Avenue, he realized the writing had been on the wall for a couple of years now, ever since the state started buying up properties along the Deuce, especially the old theaters.</p> <p><i>Plus �a change&#x2026;?</i></p> <p>Jack doubted it.</p> <p>If the magazine guy was right about the Amsterdam, then change was sure as hell coming and, as far as Jack was concerned, not for the better. Well, better if you were a landlord, but no way for a small businessman. Things would not, as the saying went, stay the same. All the quirky little stores and all the quirky people who frequented them and all the quirky people who ran them were going to go the way of the Neanderthals.</p> <p>His growing dark mood about the end of an era was blown away by the sight of a familiar face trying to hail a cab across the street from the Winter Garden. She was talking on a mobile phone as she waved her arm.</p> <p>&#x201c;Cristin?&#x201d;</p> <p>She turned and, for an instant, looked not-so-pleasantly surprised. Then she smiled. &#x201c;Jack! How nice to see you!&#x201d;</p> <p>They shared a quick, slightly awkward hug.</p> <p>He pointed to her phone&#x2014;one of the new smaller versions. Unlike the older brick-size models with the big antenna, these could fit in a pocket. He noticed NOKIA under the oblong screen.</p> <p>&#x201c;Up with the latest technology, I see.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I looove this thing! It&#x2019;s made my life so easy. No more looking for a pay phone.&#x201d;</p> <p>He gave her a lopsided grin and cocked his head toward the Winter Garden marquee. &#x201c;Going to see <i>Cats</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not likely.&#x201d;</p> <p>Their fling thing had lasted two years and during that whole period the only time they&#x2019;d been to a theater was to see Penn &amp; Teller. Cristin had ended it. She hadn&#x2019;t called it quits, per se, more like weaned them off each other. They used to get together every Sunday&#x2014;every single Sunday&#x2014;but last fall she&#x2019;d started begging off with increasingly lame excuses until Jack got the message.</p> <p>She may have engineered the actual parting, but Jack had been the reason. They&#x2019;d gone into the relationship with the understanding that they&#x2019;d get together one day a week and be friends with benefits, nothing more. Cristin had been very strict about not wanting strings and Jack had been all for it. At least at first. Along the way he became attached and started wanting more. But Cristin wasn&#x2019;t looking for more. She liked things just the way they were and wouldn&#x2019;t bend.</p> <p>Jack had suffered through the process of attenuation, but after clearing the air at an official breakup lunch between Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s, they&#x2019;d parted friends.</p> <p>Seeing Cristin again for the first time in weeks made him realize he was still carrying a torch for her.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve let your hair grow,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;A little.&#x201d;</p> <p>She had a roundish face, dark hair, blue eyes, and a bright smile that always made him want to smile too. She wore her fur-lined raincoat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can I see?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The <i>ama-gi</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You still getting off on that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about getting off&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>She rolled her eyes, did a quick turn, and lifted her hair. She had one tattoo and it decorated her nape: a Sumerian symbol known as <i>ama-gi</i>.</p> <p>He caught the briefest glimpse, and then she dropped her hair.</p> <p>&#x201c;I was heading for a late lunch&#x2026;&#x201d; he began.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;d love to, Jack, but I&#x2019;ve got to get down to FIT. I have a class.&#x201d;</p> <p>Years ago she&#x2019;d dropped out of the Fashion Institute to work full time for an event planning operation called Celebrations. The job kept her hopping all over the city, but she still wanted her degree and took one course a semester to keep herself moving toward it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Tomorrow then? Or Thursday?&#x201d;</p> <p>He hoped he didn&#x2019;t sound desperate. He didn&#x2019;t <i>feel</i> desperate&nbsp;&#x2026; he simply wanted to spend a little time with her.</p> <p>She gave him a long look. &#x201c;Just lunch?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two old friends from high school sharing food and small talk.&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled. &#x201c;That sounds great. Dutch, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p> <p>She&#x2019;d always insisted on paying her share and, since Jack wasn&#x2019;t exactly flush these days, that was a good thing. Cristin, on the other hand, made excellent money planning events.</p> <p>But where to eat?</p> <p>Apparently she already had an idea. &#x201c;I found a cool little French place on East Sixty-first called Le Pistou.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack made a face. &#x201c;Really? What&#x2019;s choice number two?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But you like French.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d; He could eat just about anything, even snails. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know if I could eat at a place called Piss Stew.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s vegetable soup.&#x201d;</p> <p>He held up his hands. &#x201c;Stop. You&#x2019;re only making it worse.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never change,&#x201d; she said through a laugh. &#x201c;Thursday&#x2019;s good. Meet there noonish?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Deal.&#x201d;</p> <p>He hailed her a cab and one pulled over right away.</p> <p>&#x201c;But just for lunch,&#x201d; she said as he held the door for her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course. We broke up, remember?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I do. But you don&#x2019;t know why.&#x201d;</p> <p>That took him by surprise. &#x201c;I thought it was because I was getting too attached.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. I was.&#x201d;</p> <p>She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek then slipped into the cab. He shook his head as he watched it weave down Seventh.</p> <p>Cristin, Cristin, Cristin&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Despite her paranoia about strings, she seemed happy with where she was in her life. He didn&#x2019;t know anybody else like that. That didn&#x2019;t mean she was going to stay put. He knew she was three years into a five-year plan that involved socking away every extra cent for now and eventually opening her own boutique to sell her original designs.</p> <p>She was also happy with <i>who</i> she was. Jack wondered what that felt like.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d read something from Wilde last year and his brain had attached it to Cristin: <i>Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else&#x2019;s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.</i> Not because Wilde had been describing Cristin, but because it was so <i>not</i> Cristin. He didn&#x2019;t know anyone who thought like Cristin. She danced to her own tune and to hell with what everyone else was playing.</p> <p>He missed her.</p> <p>When her cab disappeared into the traffic crush he turned and continued his uptown ramble.</p> <p>Okay, the week was looking better, even if it involved a French restaurant in the East Sixties. How bad could lunch be? Twenty bucks apiece? Thirty?</p> <p>Yeah, his resources had dwindled. Perhaps he&#x2019;d been too generous in his flush days. He didn&#x2019;t regret it, though. He lived a simple life. His two major expenses were rents: on his apartment and on the garage space for Ralph. Other than that, he lived on junk food and beer.</p> <p>His fix-it business hadn&#x2019;t exactly taken off. He collected a fee now and again, but the jobs were sporadic. Nothing he could count on. So he&#x2019;d been supplementing his income as a waiter in a hole-in-the-wall West Village trattoria that paid him under the table. Perhaps &#x201c;paid&#x201d; was a euphemism&#x2014;a teeny fraction of minimum wage&#x2014;but the tips were good. Everybody had heard Dylan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Positively 4th Street&#x201d; and all the tourists flocked to West 4th when they visited the Village. Trattoria Villagio waited there to provide drinks and light fare when they took a break from prowling the specialty shops.</p> <p>He checked his watch. Lots of time to kill before meeting a prospective customer at Julio&#x2019;s. Maybe he&#x2019;d grab a Whopper and train over to Brooklyn to check on an investment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by F. Paul Wilson</p></p><h2>Servants of the Map: Stories</h2><p>Spanning two centuries, an intricately woven collection of stories and novellas journey across landscapes of yearning, awakening, loss, and unexpected discovery, as a mapper of the highest mountain peaks discovers his true calling, a young woman must come to terms with a romantic fantasy, and the lives of many other extraordinary characters unfold in a borderland between science and passion.</p><p>No one limns the opposing pull of inner and outer worlds more eloquently than Andrea Barrett. Her naturalists, explorers, scientists, and healers are driven to work and above all to <i>know</i>; they categorize, theorize, and collect the phenomena of the natural world with an urgency that feels like physical need. But they are motivated equally by desire and loneliness, and the theme of domestic life runs like a countermelody through each of the six lovely, deeply memorable stories in <i>Servants of the Map</i>. The narrator of the title story, a cartographer in the Grand Trigonometrical Survey of India, is a timid, home- and family-loving man, but the Himalayas strike him with the force of a revelation. The heroine of the lyrical "Theories of Rain" is a creature of strong feelings and appetites, driven to ask questions about the world around her in the same spirit as she longs for a neighbor and mourns the brother separated from her in childhood. Her scientific curiosity is scarcely different from her desire: "Through that channel of longing, the world enters me." <p> Fans of Barrett's earlier books (the sublime <i>Ship Fever</i> and <i>Voyage of the Narwhal</i>) will delight in tracing the stories and characters that wind in and out of these three books, producing the sense of something lovely, ongoing, and whole. In the final story, Elizabeth finds consolation in her work caring for tubercular patients--"as if, in the order and precarious harmony of this house and those it shelters she might, for all that gets lost in this life, at last have found a cure." The same might be said of science, and of Barrett's art. <i>--Mary Park</i></p><b>Andrea Barrett</b> lives in Rochester, New York.</p><h2>Darkest Road (Fionavar Tapestry)</h2><p><p>In the epic conclusion to Kay&#x2019;s beloved Fionavar Tapestry, myth, magic, and the actions and choices of individual men and women come together in a climactic confrontation of the forces of light and dark, in the first of all the worlds.</p></p><p><p>GUY GAVRIEL KAY is acknowledged as one of the world&#x2019;s foremost fantasy authors.

To combat the arch evil Rakoth Maugrim, the High King of Brennin marches north with his army and allies, anticipating a final confrontation. At the same time, a crucial choice faces young Darien, the son produced by Rakoth's rape of Guinevere. Feeling rejected by the good and the light, Darien sets off on the dark road to his father. The exceptionally detailed background of this fantasy would be more impressive if it didn't suffocate a book already burdened with static narrative and turgid, poetic prose that all too fittingly captures the adolescent posturing of its transplanted college student protagonists. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hand Tool Essentials: Refine Your Power Tool Projects with Hand Tool Techniques</h2><p><p><b>Hand and Power Tools Work Best Together</b></p><p>In today's world of more-power-is-better, it's easy to overlook the value of hand tools. What most woodworker's don't realize is that combining both hand and power tool worlds is the best way to produce the highest quality woodworking.</p><p>In <i>Hand Tool Essentials</i> you'll learn how to choose and use hand tools for chopping, cutting, paring, sawing, marking, drilling and more. Many of the tools are familiar, but others will surprise you with their usefulness. Though they've been around for hundreds (or thousands) of years, these tools have gotten lost in the rush of the industrial revolution. Rediscovering the value of these tools in your woodworking will also give you a better understanding of how your power tools work.</p><p> But this book is more than about how to use hand tools. It's about using hand tools in balance with power tools to save you time, provide a more pleasant woodworking experience and ultimately give you a better woodworking project.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Shaman&#39;s Bones</h2><p><p>A women of the Tohono O'otam tribe has been savagely -- and ritually -- murdered in Wyoming, outside the jurisdictions of Granite Creek, Colorado, Police Chief Scott Parris and Ute tribal policeman Charlie Moon. But a brutal, unprovoked assault by the suspected killer on one of Parris's detectives -- and the dark, unsettling visions of Charlie's shaman aunt, Daisy Perika -- are pulling two dedicated lawmen and an aging Native American mystic into the hunt.</p><p>Daisy's dreams of raining blood tell her that more will die. Despite the healthy skepticism of his good friend Moon, Parris is inclined to heed the shaman's dire warnings. But the trail of a murderer is leading them all to perilous and unexpected places, where secrets of past betrayals and treacherous tribal politics are buried, and where the pursuit of a stolen Power has turned some men greedy and hungry. . .and deadly.</p></p><p>For mystery buffs who like a little magic mixed into their mayhem, James D. Doss serves up the third in his series of regional mysteries set on Native American reservations. In <i>The Shaman's Bones,</i> Doss's hero, tribal policeman Charlie Moon, and a Shoshone shaman named Blue Cup are both on the trail of a murderer, but their methodology is vastly different. While Charlie employs the usual police procedures to solve the crime, Blue Cup sends his spirit after the killer. What happens next makes for a spooky, gripping read.James D. Doss, recently retired from the technical staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory, now spends most of his time in a small cabin above Taos -- writing mystery fiction.

From the moment she decides to stop "futzing" around, have her eggs counted, and "get cracking"; through multiple trials of IUI, which she is intrigued to learn can be purchased in bulk packages, just like Costco; to the births of her twins, which her girlfriend gamely documents with her iPhone and selfie-stick, Brockes is never any less than bluntly and bracingly honest about her extraordinary journey to motherhood.<br> &nbsp;<br> She quizzes her friends on the pros and cons of personally knowing one's sperm donor, grapples with esoteric medical jargon and the existential brain-melt of flipping through donor catalogues and conjures with the politics of her Libertarian OB/GYN&#x2014;all the while exploring the cultural circumstances and choices that have brought her to this point. Brockes writes with charming self-effacing humor about being a British woman undergoing fertility treatment in the US, poking fun at the starkly different attitude of Americans. Anxious that biological children might not be possible, she wonders, should she resent society for how it regards and treats women who try and fail to have children? <br> &nbsp;<br> Brockes deftly uses her own story to examine how and why an increasing number of women are using fertility treatments in order to become parents&#x2014;and are doing it solo. Bringing the reader every step of the way with mordant wit and remarkable candor, Brockes shares the frustrations, embarrassments, surprises, and, finally, joys of her momentous and excellent choice.</p><p><b>Emma Brockes</b> is the author of <i>She Left Me the Gun: My Mother's Life Before Me.</i> She writes for <i>The Guardian's</i> <i>Weekend</i> magazine and has contributed to <i>The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Economist and Vogue.</i> She is the winner of two British Press Awards&#x2014;Young Journalist of the Year and Feature Writer of the Year&#x2014;and while at Oxford won the Philip Geddes Memorial Prize for Journalism.

[Brockes&#x2019;s] memoir is subtitled &#x2018;Panic and Joy on My Solo Path to Motherhood,&#x2019; but I saw no time when Brockes &#x2014; supremely confident, sensible and twice as smart as anyone else in the room &#x2014; panicked. She is cool, methodical and, at times, insanely funny, with a great eye for the ironies and amusements of life...There is no doubt that her decision &#x2014; at least for us readers &#x2014; was an excellent one indeed.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i><b>Minneapolis Star Tribune </b></i><br><br>&#x201c;The book speaks to a growing contingent of would-be parents who reach their 30s and 40s and find they have the means and motivation to have kids outside of a conventional domestic partnership, embracing their chosen single parenthood as a form of empowerment. It seems as if almost everyone bearing a child is writing a book about it, but Brockes is too original a personality to fall in quietly with the rest. A disarming and casually hilarious take on the opposite of co-parenting.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Brockes&#x2019; second memoir will have readers caught up in the excitement and anxiety of pregnancy along with her.

An elderly bearded man in a soiled, full-length down coat, grand in his way (stately, plump Buck Mulligan?), pushes a grocery cart full of various somethings in various trash bags, going faster than any of the cars.<br>Inside the cab, the air is full of drowsily potent air freshener, vaguely floral but not really suggestive of anything beyond a chemical compound that must be called &#x201c;sweet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did he tell you how long he wants to stay?&#x201d; Peter asks.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d;<br>Her eyes go soft. Worrying overmuch about Mizzy (Ethan) is a habit she can&#x2019;t break.<br>Peter doesn&#x2019;t pursue it. Who wants to go to a party in mid-argument?<br>He has a queasy stomach, and a song looping through his head. I&#x2019;m sailing away, set an open course for the virgin sea . . . Where would that have come from? He hasn&#x2019;t listened to Styx since he was in college.<br>&#x201c;We should set a limit,&#x201d; he says.<br>She sighs, settles her hand lightly on his knee, looks out the window at Eighth Avenue, up which they are now not moving at all. Rebecca is a strong-featured woman&#x2014;who is often referred to as beautiful but never as pretty. She may or may not notice these small gestures of hers, by which she consoles Peter for his own stinginess.<br>A gathering of angels appeared above my head.<br>Peter turns to look out his own window. The cars in the lane beside theirs are inching forward. A slightly battered blue Toyota-ish something creeps abreast, full of young men; raucous twenty-something boys blaring music loudly enough that Peter feels the thump-thump of it enter the cab&#x2019;s frame as they approach. There are six, no, seven of them crammed into the car, all inaudibly shouting or singing; brawny boys tarted up for Saturday night, hair gelled into tines, flickers of silver studs or chains here and there as they roughhouse and bitch-slap. The traffic in their lane picks up speed, and as they pull ahead Peter sees, thinks he sees, that one of them, one of the four clamoring in the backseat, is actually an old man, wearing what must be a spiky black wig, shouting and shoving right along with the others but thin-lipped and hollow-cheeked. He noodles the head of the boy stuffed in next to him, shouts into the boy&#x2019;s ear (flashing nuclear white veneers?), and then they&#x2019;re gone, moving with traffic. A moment later, the nimbus of sound they make has been pulled along with them. Now it&#x2019;s the brown bulk of a delivery truck that offers, in burnished gold, the wing-footed god of FTD. Flowers. Someone is getting flowers.<br>Peter turns back to Rebecca. An old man in young-guy drag is something to have observed together; it&#x2019;s not really a story to tell her, is it? Besides, aren&#x2019;t they in the middle of some kind of edgy pre-argument? In a long marriage, you learn to identify a multitude of different atmospheres and weathers.<br>Rebecca has felt his attention reenter the cab. She looks at him blankly, as if she hadn&#x2019;t fully expected to see him.<br>If he dies before she does, will she be able to sense his disembodied presence in a room?<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t throw him out on the street.&#x201d;<br>Her lips fold in primly. &#x201c;No, really, we should set some limits with him,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a good idea to always just give him whatever he thinks he wants.&#x201d;<br>What&#x2019;s this? All of a sudden, she&#x2019;s chiding him about her lost little brother?<br>&#x201c;What seems like a reasonable amount of time?&#x201d; he asks, and is astonished that she does not seem to notice the exasperation in his voice. How can they know each other so little, after all this time?<br>She pauses, considering, and then, as if she&#x2019;s forgotten an errand, leans urgently forward and asks the driver, &#x201c;How do you know it&#x2019;s an accident involving a horse?&#x201d;<br>Even in his spasm of irritation, Peter is able to marvel at women&#x2019;s ability to ask direct questions of men without seeming to pick a fight.<br>&#x201c;Call from the dispatcher,&#x201d; the driver says, waggling a finger at his earphone. His bald head sits solemnly on the brown plinth of his neck. He, of course, has his own story, and it does not in any way involve the well-dressed middle-aged couple in the back of his cab. His name, according to the plate on the back of the front seat, is Rana Saleem. India? Iran? He might have been a doctor where he comes from. Or a laborer. Or a thief. There&#x2019;s no way of knowing.<br>Rebecca nods, settles back in her seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking more about other kinds of limits,&#x201d; she says.<br>&#x201c;What kinds?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t just rely on other people forever. And, you know. We all still worry about that other thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You think that&#x2019;s something his big sister can help him with?&#x201d;<br>She closes her eyes, offended now, now, when he&#x2019;d meant to be compassionate.<br>&#x201c;What I mean,&#x201d; Peter says, &#x201c;is, well. You probably can&#x2019;t help him change his life, if he doesn&#x2019;t want to himself. I mean, a drug addict is a sort of bottomless pit.&#x201d;<br>She keeps her eyes closed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been clean for a whole year. When do we stop calling him a drug addict?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure if we ever do.&#x201d;<br>Is he getting sanctimonious? Is he just spouting 12-step truisms he&#x2019;s picked up God knows where?<br>The problem with the truth is, it&#x2019;s so often mild and clich�d.<br>She says, &#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s ready for some actual stability.&#x201d;<br>Yeah, maybe. Mizzy has informed them, via e-mail, that he&#x2019;s decided he wants to do something in the arts. That would be Something in the Arts, an occupation toward which he seems to have no cogent intentions. Doesn&#x2019;t matter. People (some people) are glad when Mizzy expresses any productive inclinations at all.<br>Peter says, &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll do what we can to give him some stability.&#x201d;<br>Rebecca squeezes his knee, affectionately. He has been good.<br>Behind them, somebody blasts his horn. What exactly does he think that&#x2019;s going to do?<br>&#x201c;Maybe we should get out here and take the train,&#x201d; she says.<br>&#x201c;We have such a perfect excuse for being late.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you think that means we have to stay late?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Absolutely not. I promise to get you out of there before Mike is drunk enough to start harassing you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That would be so lovely.&#x201d;<br>Finally they reach the corner of Eighth Avenue and Central Park South, where the remains of the accident have not yet been entirely cleared away. There, behind the flares and portable stanchions, behind the two cops redirecting traffic into Columbus Circle, is the bashed-up car, a white Mercedes canted at an angle on Fifty-ninth, luridly pink in the flare light. There is what must be the body of the horse, covered by a black tarp. The tarp, tarrily heavy, offers the rise of the horse&#x2019;s rump. The rest of the body could be anything.<br>&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; Rebecca whispers.<br>Peter knows: any accident, any reminder of the world&#x2019;s capacity to cause harm, makes her, makes both of them, panic briefly about Bea. Has she somehow come to New York without telling them? Could she conceivably have been riding in a horse carriage, even though that&#x2019;s something she&#x2019;d never do?<br>Parenthood, it seems, makes you nervous for the rest of your life. Even when your daughter is twenty and full of cheerful, impenetrable rage and not doing all that well in Boston, 240 miles away. Especially then.<br>He says, &#x201c;You never think of those horses getting hit by cars. You hardly think of them as animals.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a whole . . . cause. About the way those horses are treated.&#x201d;<br>Of course there is. Rana Saleem drives a night-shift cab here. Destitute men and women walk the streets with their feet bound in rags. The carriage horses must have dismal lives, their hooves are probably cracked and split from the concrete. How monstrous is it, to go about your business anyway?<br>&#x201c;This&#x2019;ll be good for the pro-horse people, then,&#x201d; he says.<br>Why does he sound so callous? He means to be rigorous, not hard; he himself is appalled by how he can sound. He feels at times as if he hasn&#x2019;t quite mastered the dialect of his own language&#x2014;that he&#x2019;s a less-than-fluent speaker of Peter-ese, at the age of forty-four.<br>No, he&#x2019;s still only forty-three. Why does he keep wanting to add a year?<br>No, wait, he turned forty-four last month.<br>&#x201c;So maybe the poor thing didn&#x2019;t die in vain,&#x201d; Rebecca says. She runs a fingertip consolingly along Peter&#x2019;s jaw.<br>What marriage doesn&#x2019;t involve uncountable accretions, a language of gestures, a sense of recognition sharp as a toothache? Unhappy, sure. What couple isn&#x2019;t unhappy, at least part of the time? But how can the divorce rate be, as they say, skyrocketing? How miserable would you have to get to be able to bear the actual separation, to go off and live your life so utterly unrecognized?<br>&#x201c;A mess,&#x201d; the driver says.<br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br>And yet, of course, Peter is mesmerized by the ruined car and the horse&#x2019;s body. Isn&#x2019;t this the bitter pleasure of New York City? It&#x2019;s a mess, like Courbet&#x2019;s Paris was. It&#x2019;s squalid and smelly; it&#x2019;s harmful.

The beans, along with corn, chiles, and tomatoes, have become key ingredients in the new American food revolution centered in Sando&#x2019;s native San Francisco Bay Area. In fact, Sando and Rancho Gordo were named number two on <i>Saveur Magazine</i>&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Saveur 100 list for 2008.&#x201d; <i>Bon Appetit</i> magazine declared Sando one of the Hot 10 in the food world of 2009. <i>Food + Wine</i> magazine placed Steve &#x201c;at the forefront of the current seed-saving movement.&#x201d;&nbsp; Steve&#x2019;s previous book, with Vanessa Barrington, was <i>Heirloom Beans</i> (Chronicle, 2008).<br><br>Steve Sando came to agriculture not from the 4H club but from the grocery store. As a frustrated home cook, he decided to grow the ingredients he wanted in his kitchen. At the forefront of neglected ingredients were beans. Although they are an indigenous product of the Americas, the only beans available commercially to most home cooks were pintos, navies, and kidneys. Discovering heirloom beans to be as rich and varied as heirloom tomatoes, Sando almost singlehandedly created the market for these unique and worthwhile legumes. He now grows more than 25 varieties in California and works with small indigenous farmers in Mexico to import their heirloom beans for the U.S. market. He lives in Napa and travels frequently throughout the Americas collecting beans, friends, and adventures.<br></p><h2>Red Classics the Lair of the White Worm</h2><p>An ancient evil walks among them.

The luminous palette and spontaneous brushwork of Renoir, Monet et al. inspired or coincided with an individualistic, responsive approach taken by painters from Canada and Latin America to Russia and the Far East. In Britain, the impressionist impulse helped liberate artists from Victorian painting's moralizing norms; in Japan, it fostered a style able to convey the artist's unique personality; in places as diverse as Italy, Finland and Australia, it became linked with nationalist aspirations. Childe Hassam (U.S.), Anders Zorn (Sweden), Ilya Repin and Igor Grabar (Russia) and Joaquin Sorolla (Spain) are among scores of painters profiled in a marvelously illustrated volume that will forever change the way we look at impressionism.

This fascinating study does away with the propaganda and opens our eyes to who really established the civilized world. Delving deep into history, Terry Jones and Alan Ereira uncover the impressive cultural and technological achievements of the Celts, Goths, Persians, and Vandals.

(apart from, of course, the "sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health"). The director of that movie&#x2014;and now popular historian&#x2014;Jones (<i>Who Murdered Chaucer?</i>), along with Ereira (<i>The People's England</i>), now answer the question: a bit, but nowhere near as much as the barbarians did. Jones attempts to overturn the popular conception of the glorious Roman Empire, which he says is mostly propaganda, and claims that the barbarians&#x2014;a general term describing the tribes of western and northern Europe, as well as of the Middle East&#x2014;have for too long been slandered as "savages" by the allegedly more advanced and civilized Romans and their descendants. In fact, these assorted Celts, Vandals, Persians and Goths were technologically, economically and intellectually sophisticated, but were on the wrong side of history. While scholars will sniff at Jones's offhand humor, somewhat wide-eyed "revelations"&#x2014;which have been revealed before&#x2014;and tendency to believe the vastly exaggerated death tolls of the time (he relies on Plutarch's figure that Julius Caesar slaughtered a million Gauls, a virtually impossible feat), readers will go along for a most enjoyable ride and appreciate his fascinating tale of the barbarians' lost world. 24 pages of color photos, maps. <i>(Sept. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As with artistic, intellectual, and scientific production, culture is immediately produced as sign and as exchange value. Hence, in modern society consumption defines the stages where the commodity is immediately produced as sign, and signs as commodities. <br><br> This collection of essays attempts an analysis of the sign form in the same way that Marx's critique of political economy sought an analysis of the commodity form: as the commodity is at the same time both exchange value and use value, the sign is both signifier and signified. Thus, it necessitates an analysis on two levels, with the author confronting all of the conceptual obstacles of semiology in order to provide the same radical critique that Marx developed of classical political economy.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Sol Majestic: A novel</h2><p><p><b><i>The Sol Majestic</i> is a big-hearted and delightful intergalactic adventure for fans of Becky Chambers and <i>The Good Place</i></b> </p><p>"A feast of a book.&#x201d;&#x2015;Hugo Award-winning author Seanan McGuire </p><p>Kenna, an aspirational teen guru, wanders destitute across the stars as he tries to achieve his parents' ambition to advise the celestial elite. </p><p>Everything changes when Kenna wins a free dinner at The Sol Majestic, the galaxy's most renowned restaurant, giving him access to the cosmos's one-percent.

Crosby lives in Virginia with her family.<b> Chapter 1 </b> <p> St. Thomas Aquinas once said sorrow could be alleviated by good sleep, a bath, and a glass of wine. Lucky him, if that's all it took. </p><p> Hector died shortly before Labor Day, the last event in a tumultuous summer weighed down by heat straight out of hell's waiting room. He'd been like a father to me, managing the crew at my family's vineyard in the foothills of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains for the last twenty years. His death came hard on the heels of my second auto accident in the past three years, when the front end of my old Volvo collided with the back end of a large buck. And that event had been preceded by Hurricane Iola, whose wicked ways wreaked havoc just as we were about to harvest our white wines. If the month of August had been a fish, I would have thrown it back. </p><p> Fortunately autumn arrived in a kinder mood. The withering temperatures receded and the low-slanted sunlight washed everything in softer colors, blurring the sharp edges of the shadows. The air no longer smelled as though it had been boiled and the relentless metallic sound of the cicadas began to wane. Tonight, on an October Indian summer evening, the bullfrogs' serenade sounded plaintive. </p><p> I'd invited Mick Dunne, my neighbor and a man with whom I'd had a white-hot affair last spring, to dinner and a lecture on wine at Mount Vernon. Though we'd only just arrived, he'd glanced at his watch three times in the last fifteen minutes. Each time, I pretended not to notice. </p><p> When Joe Dawson, my cousin's fianc�, had given me the tickets, I figured asking Mick would be a good way to let him know I'd moved on since last spring and that we could still do things together as friends. Besides, he'd just planted thirty acres of vines on land adjacent to mine. We needed to get along. </p><p> Right now, though, unless George Washington himself turned </p><p> up to offer Mick a tour of the place or told him they could nip down to the whiskey distillery, I already regretted the evening. Though Mick tried to mask his restlessness with well-bred feigned interest as only the British can, I knew he was bored. </p><p> We walked along a shady path that bordered an expanse of lawn known as the bowling green. Washington had planted some of the larger trees -- tulip poplars, white ash, and elms -- himself. I reached for Mick's arm to keep from stumbling on the uneven terrain. Ever since a near-fatal car accident three years ago left me with a deformed left foot, I needed a cane to keep my balance. Mick glanced down as I slid my arm through his. Another opportunity to peek at his watch. </p><p> I gave it one more try. "There's a fabulous view of the Potomac River from the other side of the mansion. Wait until you see it." </p><p> "Really? How marvelous." It sounded like I'd just offered him a cigarette before he got the blindfold. </p><p> "There's also a sundial in the middle of the courtyard. Too bad it's nearly sunset or you could check the time there, too," I said. </p><p> There was a moment of stunned silence before his laugh erupted like champagne fizz. "Sorry, love. I'm distracted tonight." His arm slid around my waist. "I didn't mean to be rude." </p><p> Love. Had the word slipped out, or was it intentional? </p><p> "Why did you come tonight, if you're not interested in this lecture?" I asked. </p><p> His arm tightened. "I am interested. But not in some woman giving a dull talk." </p><p> My face felt warm. "Joe said she's supposed to be riveting." </p><p> She was also Joe's friend. I moved out of the circle of Mick's arm. </p><p> "Not many people here," he said. "She can't be too riveting." </p><p> "That's because it's a select audience. I'm sure she'll be fascinating." </p><p> He stuck his hands in his pockets and grinned like I'd said something amusing. "Have you read her book?" </p><p> "I haven't even read the newspaper since August we've been so busy with harvest." </p><p> "Then let's have dinner and slope off. Come on, Lucie. Who cares if we stick around?" </p><p> "Joe cares. I promised him we'd stay for the whole evening. Anyway, I think her book sounds interesting. She followed Thomas </p><p> Jefferson's voyage through the European vineyards when he was ambassador to France." </p><p> I got another gun-to-the-head look from him. "Why isn't she at Monticello if she wrote about Jefferson? What's she doing here?" </p><p> "Because Jefferson bought a lot of George Washington's wines for him. And she is going to Monticello. I think Joe said she's going to wrap up her book tour in Charlottesville. She just finished traveling around California. Now she's doing the East Coast." </p><p> We had come to the ivy-covered colonnade connecting Washington's servants' quarters to the main house. In the distance the river gleamed like dull pewter. I led Mick to the embankment where the ground fell away, leaving a view of the Potomac that stretched to the horizon. In the dusky light, the river -- friendlier to pleasure boaters and fishermen where it snaked ribbonlike past Washington -- looked vast and depthless here at Mount Vernon. </p><p> We stood in silence until finally he said, "You were right. It's an incredible view." </p><p> I had not expected him to sound wistful. "I thought you'd like it." </p><p> "Those cliffs remind me of Wales." His voice was soft with nostalgia. "We used to go up from London on summer holiday when I was a boy. My Lord, how I loved it there. On the north coast, the castles are perched on the bluffs just like this, except it's all rocks to the Irish Sea." </p><p> I believe that it is possible to miss a place you love so much that the ache is physical. I'd read that Washington pined terribly for his home when he was away from it -- which was often -- fulfilling his duties as commander in chief of the Continental Army or in Philadelphia as the first president. Staring at his cherished view, which had changed little since he and Martha looked out on it centuries ago, I knew I, too, would be homesick for this breathtaking place, just as Mick sounded homesick now for the north coast of Wales. </p><p> A bell rang behind us and I turned around. The western sky was the color of liquid gold and the mansion appeared to be sitting inside a rim of fire. Silhouetted figures began to converge on the columned piazza. </p><p> "The tour must be starting," I said. "I wonder where Joe is." </p><p> "He'll turn up." Mick's arm slid around my waist again and this time I let it linger. As we reached the house, I saw a man and woman framed like a cameo in one of the colonnaded archways. Lantern light from the east courtyard illuminated his face as he leaned close to her, placing a hand on her shoulder. The woman tucked a strand of shoulder-length blonde hair behind one ear. Then she reached up and pulled his head down for a long, slow kiss. I couldn't stop watching them. The man was my cousin's fianc�, Joe Dawson. I did not know the woman, but she sure as hell wasn't Dominique. </p><p> "Come on," Mick said. "The crowd's moving. We'll miss what the guide is saying." </p><p> Either he hadn't seen what I just witnessed or else he didn't recognize Joe. </p><p> "Coming." </p><p> I had taken this tour so often over the years I could practically give it, but Mick, who had moved to Virginia six months ago, had never been to Mount Vernon. We began in the dining room, the largest room in the house, which had been restored to its original colors -- two eye-popping shades of Washington's favorite green. I was glad to see Mick interested in the docent's talk, but I couldn't stop thinking about Joe and that blonde. </p><p> It didn't take long before I found out who she was. Someone jostled an elderly woman as the group moved out of the dining room. The book she'd been holding hit the floor and landed at my feet. I picked it up. <i>European Travels with Thomas Jefferson's Ghost</i> by Valerie Beauvais. </p><p> Joe had been making out with the guest of honor. </p><p> "Thank you so much, dear." The woman smiled, pearl-white teeth in a face as wrinkled as old fruit. "So clumsy of me." </p><p> "So clumsy of whoever bumped into you." I'd picked up the book facedown so I was staring at the author photo. No wonder they'd splashed it on the back cover. She had the racy good looks of a fashion model, a slightly lopsided smile, and a sly, almost naughty expression like she'd been talking dirty with the photographer. Stunning but tough-looking. By the time our tour finished winding in and out of the house and up two flights of stairs, I decided I didn't like Valerie Beauvais. </p><p> Turned out I had company. After we'd seen the house, everyone spilled out on to the lawn where buffet tables had now been set up for dinner. I saw Ryan Worth, wine critic for the <i>Washington Tribune</i>, sitting in one of the Windsor chairs lining the piazza. He got up and waved, heading toward Mick and me. On the way he flagged down a waiter holding a tray of champagne flutes. Ryan handed a glass to me, then helped himself to two more for Mick and himself. </p><p> "Don't be a stranger," he said to the waiter. He clinked his glass against ours. "Tell me why you two have to be here. I came because I'm getting paid to introduce the guest of honor." He looked like he'd been asked to gargle with Dra�no. </p><p> Ryan wrote "Worthwhile Wines," a weekly column that was syndicated in more than two hundred newspapers, a statistic he frequently enjoyed quoting. Short, wide, in his late thirties, with thinning black hair, his Van Dyke and pursed-lip smile made him appear slightly sinister, or else like he knew something I should but didn't. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of wines and wine history, though sometimes he took himself too seriously, acting as though he were sharing information he'd brought down from the mountain on stone tablets. Still, I respected him. He knew his stuff. </p><p> "I'm here because Lucie dragged me," Mick said. </p><p> "Oh, come on," I said. "We've been over this. Dinner and a talk. How bad can it be?" </p><p> "Obviously you've never heard Valerie." Ryan covered his mouth and faked a yawn. "She may look like a babe but she can clear a room faster than someone yelling 'fire.' As for her book -- " </p><p> "Talking about me behind my back?" Valerie Beauvais had a husky Bacall-l...</p></p><h2>A Potter&#39;s Book</h2><p>This book is not only applicable to pottery, sculpture, and design, beautiful old world teachings</p><p>Bernard Leach (1887-1979) was one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century pottery. Born in Hong Kong and brought up in Japan, Hong Kong and England, he trained at the London School of Art and moved to Japan in 1909, where he studied pottery techniques. In 1920 on his return to England he founded the Leach Pottery with Shoji Hamada in St Ives, Cornwall. His best-known work, A Potter&#39;s Book, was first published in 1940."Mr. Leach has worked for a quarter of a century first in the Far East and more recently in England, and his output combines the best qualities of both worlds." -- <i>TLS</i><br><br>"It is the soundest and most detailed book which has ever been written on this subject, and any potter, connoisseur or student of ceramics who neglects to buy it is making a very stupid omission." -- Maurice Collis in <i>Time and Tide</i><br></p><h2>Earth Sheltered Homes: Plans and Designs: Underground Space Center, University of Minnesota</h2><p>Describes the features of a variety of earth sheltered homes</p><p></p><h2>The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why</h2><p>Everyone knows that while different cultures may think about the world differently, they use the same equipment for doing their thinking. Everyone knows that whatever the skin color, nationality, or religion, every human being uses the same tools for perception, for memory, and for reasoning. Everyone knows that a logically true statement is true in English, German, or Hindi. Everyone knows that when a Chinese and an American look at the same painting, they see the same painting. But what if everyone is wrong? When psychologist Richard E. Nisbett showed an animated underwater scene to his American students, they zeroed in on a big fish swimming among smaller fish. Japanese subjects, on the other hand, made observations about the background environment -- and the different "seeings" are a clue to profound underlying cognitive differences between Westerners and East Asians. For, as Professor Nisbett shows in <i>The Geography of Thought,</i> people actually think about -- and even see -- the world differently because of differing ecologies, social structures, philosophies, and educational systems that date back to ancient Greece and China and that have survived into the modern world. As a result, East Asian thought is "holistic" -- drawn to the perceptual field as a whole and to relations among objects and events within that field. By comparison to Western modes of reasoning, East Asian thought relies far less on categories or on formal logic; it is fundamentally dialectic, seeking a "middle way" between opposing thoughts. By contrast, Westerners focus on salient objects or people, use attributes to assign them to catergories, and apply rules of formal logic to understand their behavior. <i>The Geography of Thought</i> documents Professor Nisbett's groundbreaking international research in cultural psychology, a series of comparative studies both persuasive in their rigor and startling in their conclusions, addressing questions such as: ? Why did the ancient Chinese excel at algebra and arithmetic, but not geometry, the brilliant achievement of such Greeks as Euclid? ? Why do East Asians find it so difficult to disentangle an object from its surroundings? ? Why do Western infants learn nouns more rapidly than verbs, when it is the other way around in East Asia? ? What are the implications of these cognitive differences for the future of international politics? Do they support a Fukuyamaesque "end of history" scenario or a Huntingtonian "clash of civilizations"? From feng shui to metaphysics, from comparative linguistics to economic history, a gulf separates the children of Aristotle from the descendants of Confucius. At a moment in history when the need for cross-cultural understanding and collaboration have never been more important, <i>The Geography of Thought</i> offers both a map to that gulf and a blueprint for a bridge that might be able to span it.</p><p><b>Richard E.

More than two billion are the heirs of ancient Chinese traditions of thought. The philosophies and achievements of the Greeks and Chinese of 2,500 years ago were remarkably different, as were the social structures and conceptions of themselves. And, as I hope to show in this chapter, the intellectual aspects of each society make sense in light of their social characteristics. </p><p><br> The Ancient Greeks and Agency </p><p> There is an ancient theater at Epidaurus in Greece that holds fourteen thousand people. Built into a hillside, the theater has a spectacular view of mountains and pine trees. Its acoustics are such that it is possible to hear a piece of paper being crumpled on the stage from any location in the theater. Greeks of the classical period, from the sixth to the third century B.C., traveled for long periods under difficult conditions to attend plays and poetry readings at Epidaurus from dawn till dusk for several days in a row. </p><p> To us today, people's love of the theater and their willingness to endure some hardship to indulge it may not seem terribly odd. But among the great civilizations of the day, including Persia, India, and the Middle East, as well as China, it is possible to imagine only the Greeks feeling free enough, being confident enough in their ability to control their own lives, to go on a long journey for the sole purpose of aesthetic enjoyment. The Greeks' contemporaries lived in more or less autocratic societies in which the king's will was law and to defy it was to court death. It would not have been in a ruler's interest to allow his subjects to wander about the countryside even if his subjects' ties to the land and the routines of agriculture had allowed them to imagine going on a long journey for purposes of recreation. </p><p> Equally astonishing, even to us today, is that the entire Greek nation laid down its tools -- including its arms if city-states were at war with one another -- to participate in the Olympics as athletes or audience. </p><p> The Greeks, more than any other ancient peoples, and in fact more than most people on the planet today, had a remarkable sense of personal <i>agency</i> -- the sense that they were in charge of their own lives and free to act as they chose. One definition of happiness for the Greeks was that it consisted of being able to exercise their powers in pursuit of excellence in a life free from constraints. </p><p> A strong sense of individual identity accompanied the Greek sense of personal agency. Whether it is the Greeks or the Hebrews who invented individualism is a matter of some controversy, but there is no doubt that the Greeks viewed themselves as unique individuals, with distinctive attributes and goals. This would have been true at least by the time of Homer in the eighth or ninth century B.C. Both gods and humans in the <i>Odyssey</i> and the <i>Iliad</i> have personalities that are fully formed and individuated. Moreover, the differences among individuals were of substantial interest to Greek philosophers. </p><p> The Greek sense of agency fueled a tradition of debate. Homer makes it clear that a man is defined almost as much by his ability to debate as by his prowess as a warrior. A commoner could challenge even a king and not only live to tell the tale, but occasionally sway an audience to his side. Debates occurred in the marketplace, the political assembly, and even in military settings. Uniquely among ancient civilizations, great matters of state, as well as the most ordinary questions, were often decided by public, rhetorical combat rather than by authoritarian fiat. Tyrannies were not common in Greece and, when they arose, were frequently replaced by oligarchies or, beginning in the fifth century B.C., by democracies. The constitutions of some cities had mechanisms to prevent officials from becoming tyrants. For example, the city of Drerus on Crete prohibited a man from holding the office of <i>kosmos</i> (magistrate) until ten years had gone by since the last time he held the office. </p><p> As striking as the Greeks' freedom and individuality is their sense of curiosity about the world. Aristotle thought that curiosity was the uniquely defining property of human beings. St. Luke said of the Athenians of a later era: "They spend their time in nothing else but to tell or to hear some new thing." The Greeks, far more than their contemporaries, speculated about the nature of the world they found themselves in and created models of it. They constructed these models by categorizing objects and events and generating rules about them that were sufficiently precise for systematic description and explanation. This characterized their advances in -- some have said invention of -- the fields of physics, astronomy, axiomatic geometry, formal logic, rational philosophy, natural history, and ethnography. (The word "ethnocentric" is of Greek origin. The term resulted from the Greeks' recognition that their belief that their way of life was superior to that of the Persians might be based on mere prejudice. They decided it was not.) </p><p> Whereas many great contemporary civilizations, as well as the earlier Mesopotamian and Egyptian and the later Mayan civilizations, made systematic observations in all scientific domains, only the Greeks attempted to explain their observations in terms of underlying principles. Exploring these principles was a source of pleasure for the Greeks. Our word "school" comes from the Greek schole-, meaning "leisure." Leisure meant for the Greeks, among other things, the freedom to pursue knowledge. The merchants of Athens were happy to send their sons to school so that they could indulge their curiosity. </p><p><br> The Ancient Chinese and Harmony </p><p> While a special occasion for the ancient Greek might mean attendance at plays and poetry readings, a special occasion for the Chinese of the same period would be an opportunity to visit with friends and family. There was a practice called <i>chuan men,</i> literally "make doors a chain." Visits, which were intended to show respect for the hosts, were especially common during the major holidays. Those who were visited early were perceived as more important than those who were visited later. </p><p> The Chinese counterpart to Greek agency was <i>harmony.</i> Every Chinese was first and foremost a member of a collective, or rather of several collectives -- the clan, the village, and especially the family. The individual was not, as for the Greeks, an encapsulated unit who maintained a unique identity across social settings. Instead, as philosopher Henry Rosemont has written: "...For the early Confucians, there can be no me in isolation, to be considered abstractly: I am the totality of roles I live in relation to specific others...Taken collectively, they weave, for each of us, a unique pattern of personal identity, such that if some of my roles change, the others will of necessity change also, literally making me a different person." </p><p> The Chinese were concerned less with issues of control of others or the environment than with self-control, so as to minimize friction with others in the family and village and to make it easier to obey the requirements of the state, administered by magistrates. The ideal of happiness was not, as for the Greeks, a life allowing the free exercise of distinctive talents, but the satisfactions of a plain country life shared within a harmonious social network. Whereas Greek vases and wine goblets show pictures of battles, athletic contests, and bacchanalian parties, ancient Chinese scrolls and porcelains depict scenes of family activities and rural pleasures. </p><p> The Chinese would not have felt themselves to be the helpless pawns of superiors and family members. On the contrary, there would have been a sense of <i>collective agency.</i> The chief moral system of China -- Confucianism -- was essentially an elaboration of the obligations that obtained between emperor and subject, parent and child, husband and wife, older brother and younger brother, and between friend and friend. Chinese society made the individual feel very much a part of a large, complex, and generally benign social organism where clear mutual obligations served as a guide to ethical conduct. Carrying out prescribed roles -- in an organized, hierarchical system -- was the essence of Chinese daily life. There was no counterpart to the Greek sense of personal liberty. Individual rights in China were one's "share" of the rights of the community as a whole, not a license to do as one pleased. </p><p> Within the social group, any form of confrontation, such as debate, was discouraged. Though there was a time, called the period of the "hundred schools" of 600 to 200 B.C., during which polite debate occurred, at least among philosophers, anything resembling public disagreement was discouraged. As the British philosopher of science Geoffrey Lloyd has written, "In philosophy, in medicine, and elsewhere there is criticism of other points of view...[but] the Chinese generally conceded far more readily than did the Greeks, that other opinions had something to be said for them..." </p><p> Their monophonic music reflected the Chinese concern with unity. Singers would all sing the same melody and musical instruments played the same notes at the same time. Not surprisingly, it was the Greeks who invented polyphonic music, where different instruments, and different voices, take different parts. </p><p> Chinese social harmony should not be confused with conformity. On the contrary, Confucius praised the desire of the gentleman to harmonize and distinguished it from the petty person's need for conformity. The <i>Zuozhuan,</i> a classic Confucian text, makes the distinction in a metaphor about cooking. A good cook blends the flavors and creates something harmonious and delicious. No flavor is completely submerged, and the savory taste is due to the blended but distinctive contributions of each flavor. </p><p> The Chinese approach to understanding the natural world was as different from that of the Greeks as their understanding of themselves. Early in their study of the heavens, the Chinese believed that cosmic events such as comets and eclipses could predict important occurrences on earth, such as the birth of conquerors. But when they discovered the regularities in these events, so far from building models of them, they lost interest in them. </p><p> The lack of wonder among the Chinese is especially remarkable in light of the fact that Chinese civilization far outdistanced Greek civilization technologically. The Chinese have been credited with the original or independent invention of irrigation systems, ink, porcelain, the magnetic compass, stirrups, the wheelbarrow, deep drilling, the Pascal triangle, pound locks on canals, fore-and-aft sailing, watertight compartments, the sternpost rudder, the paddle-wheel boat, quantitative cartography, immunization techniques, astronomical observations of novae, seismographs, and acoustics. Many of these technological achievements were in place at a time when Greece had virtually none. </p><p> But, as philosopher Hajime Nakamura notes, the Chinese advances reflected a genius for practicality, not a penchant for scientific theory and investigation. And as philosopher and sinologist Donald Munro has written, "In Confucianism there was no thought of <i>knowing</i> that did not entail some consequence for action." </p><p><br> Essence or Evanescence? </p><p><br> Philosophy in Greece and China </p><p> The philosophies of Greece and China reflected their distinctive social practices. The Greeks were concerned with understanding the fundamental nature of the world, though in ways that were different in different eras. The philosophers of Ionia (including western Turkey, Sicily, and southern Italy) of the sixth century B.C. were thoroughly empirical in orientation, building their theories on a base of sense observation. But the fifth century saw a move toward abstraction and distrust of the senses. Plato thought that ideas -- the <i>forms</i> -- had a genuine reality and that the world could be understood through logical approaches to their meaning, without reference to the world of the senses. If the senses seemed to contradict conclusions reached from first principles and logic, it was the senses that had to be ignored. </p><p> Though Aristotle did not grant reality to the forms, he thought of attributes as having a reality distinct from their concrete embodiments in objects. For him it was meaningful to speak not just of a solid object, but of attributes in the abstract -- solidity, whiteness, etc. -- and to have theories about these abstractions. The central, basic, sine qua non properties of an object constituted its "essence," which was unchanging by definition, since if the essence of an object changed it was no longer the object but something else. The properties of an object that could change without changing the object's essence were "accidental" properties. For example, the author is sadly lacking in musical talent, but if he suddenly were to have musical talent, you would still think he was the same person. Musical talent, then, is an accidental property, and change in it does not constitute change in the person's essence. Greek philosophy thus differed greatly from Chinese in that it was deeply concerned with the question of which properties made an object what it was, and which were alterable without changing the nature of the object. </p><p> The Greek language itself encouraged a focus on attributes and on turning attributes into abstractions. As in other Indo-European languages, every adjective can be granted noun status by adding the English equivalent of "ness" as a suffix: "white" becomes "whiteness"; "kind" becomes "kindness." A routine habit of Greek philosophers was to analyze the attributes of an object -- person, place, thing, or animal -- and categorize the object on the basis of its abstracted attributes. They would then attempt to understand the object's nature, and the cause of its actions, on the basis of rules governing the categories. So the attributes of a comet would be noted and the object would then be categorized at various levels of abstraction -- <i>this</i> comet, <i>a</i> comet, a heavenly body, a moving object. Rules at various levels of abstraction would be generated as hypotheses and the behavior of the comet explained in terms of rules that seemed to work at a given level of abstraction. </p><p> But still more basic to Greek philosophy is its background scheme, which regarded the object <i>in isolation</i> as the proper focus of attention and analysis. Most Greeks regarded matter as particulate and separate -- formed into discrete objects -- just as humans were seen as separate from one another and construed as distinct wholes. Once the object is taken as the starting point, then many things follow automatically: The attributes of the object are salient; the attributes become the basis of categorization of the object; the categories become the basis of rule construction; and events are then understood as the result of objects behaving in accordance with rules. By "objects" I mean both nonhuman and human objects, but in fact the nature of the physical...</p></p><h2>Law and Disorder &amp; Secret Bodyguard (The Finnegan Connection, 1)</h2><p><strong>BESTSELLING AUTHOR COLLECTION</strong><br><br><strong><em>Reader-favorite romances in collectible volumes from our bestselling authors.</em></strong><br><br><strong>A FEARLESS ROMANCE</strong><br><br>Desperate to escape her kidnappers, Kody Cameron can turn to only one man...and he&#x2019;s holding a gun.

Award-winning author Robert D. San Souci and Jean and Mou-Sien Tseng have created an elegant, visually stunning retelling of the popular Chinese legend. When Fa Mulan learns that her father has been drafted into Khan's army to fight the Tartars, she is shocked--her father is far too old and weak to go to war. She forms a brave plan, which her family reluctantly accepts, and, "At dawn she cut her hair short, put on her father's armor, and fastened his weapons to the horse's saddle." <p> Fa Mulan is excited and afraid, and soon finds herself engaged in fierce combat with the Tartars. She studies the art of war, and becomes skilled with the sword. As her accomplishments gain fame, she is called to appear before the Khan in the royal city of Loyang. Fearing the discovery of her true gender, Mulan is anxious about the consequences for her family. But she needn't have worried; "'General,' the Khan began, 'you have served me well and have brought honor to your family. Your deeds are enough to fill twelve books. I give you a thousand strings of copper coins as a reward. What else do you wish?'" Relieved, the woman warrior simply asks to go home. </p><p> The noble story of this legendary Chinese heroine has inspired poets, writers, artists, dramatists, and readers worldwide for centuries. This particular retelling dates back to the earliest versions of <i>The Song of Mulan</i>, probably composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties (A.D. 420 to A.D. 589). San Souci's carefully researched interpretation of the ancient story is gentle, dramatic, and inspiring, and the Tsengs' beautiful, expressive watercolor paintings, bordered top and bottom like a Chinese scroll, are lovely.

It&#x2019;s a simple and fundamental question that still bewilders us, despite a seemingly infinite amount of available information on which foods are best for our bodies. Scientists, dieticians, and even governments regularly publish research on the dangers of too much fat and sugar, as well as on the benefits of exercise, and yet the global obesity crisis is only worsening. Most diet plans prove to be only short-term solutions, and few strategies work for everyone. Why can one person eat a certain meal and gain weight, while another eating the same meal drops pounds? Part of the truth lies in genetics, but more and more, scientists are finding that the answer isn&#x2019;t so much what we put into our stomachs, but rather the essential digestive microbes already in them.Drawing on the latest science and his team's own pioneering research, The Diet Myth explores the hidden world of the microbiome, and demystifies the common misconceptions about fat, calories, vitamins, and nutrients. Dr. Tim Spector shows us that only by understanding what makes our own personal microbes tick and interact can we overcome the confusion of modern nutrition, allowing us to regain natural balance in our bodies. Countless recent scientific papers have been written on weight-loss topics like prebiotics and fructans, and The Diet Myth gathers these latest findings into one place, revealing new information about how best to lose weight and manage our bodies. Mixing cutting-edge discoveries, illuminating science, and his own case studies, Spector reveals why we should abandon fads and instead embrace diversity for a balanced diet, a healthy stomach, and a nourished body.</p><p><strong>Tim Spector</strong>&nbsp;is Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King&#x2019;s College London and a consultant physician at Guy&#x2019;s and St Thomas&#x2019;s Hospital.

The setting sun splashed gold along a distant crest so that it seemed to hang in the air unsupported, a vein of light in the distance. Behind him, the murmur of conversation rose and fell without interrupting his thoughts. He could smell honeysuckle on the breeze and the touch of it in his nostrils made his own rank sweat even more pungent as the delicate fragrance shifted in the air and was gone.<br><br>It had been a long day. When he pressed a hand against his eyes, he could feel a surge of exhaustion rise in him like dark water. The voices in the campaign room mingled with the creak of chairs and the rustle of maps. How many hundreds of evenings had he spent on the upper floor of the fort with those men? The routine had become a comfort for them all at the end of a day, and even when there was nothing to discuss, they still gathered in the campaign rooms to drink and talk. It kept Rome alive in their minds and at times they could almost forget that they had not seen their home for more than four years.<br><br>At first, Julius had embraced the problems of the regions and hardly thought of Rome for months at a time. The days had flown as he rose and slept with the sun and the Tenth made towns in the wilderness. On the coast, Valentia had been transformed with lime and wood and paint until it was almost a new city veneered over the old. They had laid roads to chain the land and bridges that opened the wild hills to settlers. Julius had worked with a frenetic, twitching energy in those first years, using exhaustion like a drug to force away his memories. Then he would sleep and Cornelia would come to him. Those were the nights when he would leave his sweat-soaked bed and ride out to the watch posts, appearing out of the darkness unannounced until the Tenth were as nervous and tired as he was himself.<br><br>As if to mock his indifference, his engineers had found gold in two new seams, richer than any they had known before. The yellow metal had its own allure, and when Julius had seen the first haul spilled out of a cloth onto his desk, he had looked at it with hatred for what it represented. He had come to Spain with nothing, but the ground gave up its secrets and with the wealth came the tug of the old city and the life he had almost forgotten.<br><br>He sighed at the thought. Spain was such a treasure-house it would be difficult to leave her, but part of him knew he could not lose himself there for much longer. Life was too precious to be wasted, and too short.<br><br>The room was warm with the press of bodies. The maps of the new mines were stretched out on low tables, held by weights. Julius could hear Renius arguing with Brutus and the low cadence of Domitius chuckling. Only the giant Ciro was silent. Yet even those who spoke were marking time until Julius joined them. They were good men. Each one of them had stood with him against enemies and through grief, and there were times when Julius could imagine how it might have been to cross the world with them. They were men to walk a finer path than to be forgotten in Spain, and Julius could not bear the sympathy he saw in their eyes. He knew he deserved only contempt for having brought them to that place and buried himself in petty work.<br><br>If Cornelia had lived, he would have taken her with him to Spain. It would have been a new start, far away from the intrigues of the city. He bowed his head as the evening breeze touched his face. It was an old pain and there were whole days when he did not think of her. Then the guilt would surface and the dreams would be terrible, as if in punishment for the lapse.<br><br>"Julius? The guard is at the door for you," Brutus said, touching him on the shoulder. Julius nodded and turned back to the men in the room, his eyes seeking out the stranger amongst them.<br><br>The legionary looked nervous as he glanced around at the map-laden tables and the jugs of wine, clearly awed by the people within.<br><br>"Well?" Julius said.<br><br>The soldier swallowed as he met the dark eyes of his general. There was no kindness in that hard, fleshless face, and the young legionary stammered slightly.<br><br>"A young Spanish at the gate, General. He says he's the one we're looking for."<br><br>The conversations in the room died away and the guard wished he were anywhere else but under the scrutiny of those men.<br><br>"Have you checked him for weapons?" Julius said.<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Then bring him to me. I want to speak to the man who has caused me so much trouble."<br><br>Julius stood waiting at the top of the stairs as the Spaniard was brought up. His clothes were too small for his gangling limbs, and the face was caught in the change between man and boy, though there was no softness in the bony jaw. As their eyes met, the Spaniard hesitated, stumbling.<br><br>"What's your name, boy?" Julius said as they came level.<br><br>"Adan," the Spaniard forced out.<br><br>"You killed my officer?" Julius said, with a sneer.<br><br>The young man froze, then nodded, his expression wavering between fear and determination. He could see the faces turned toward him in the room, and his courage seemed to desert him then at the thought of stepping into their midst. He might have held back if the guard hadn't shoved him across the threshold.<br><br>"Wait below," Julius told the legionary, suddenly irritated.<br><br>Adan refused to bow his head in the face of the hostile glares of the Romans, though he could not remember being more frightened in his life. As Julius closed the door behind him, he started silently, cursing his nervousness. Adan watched as the general sat down facing him, and a dull terror overwhelmed him. Should he keep his hands by his sides? All of a sudden, they seemed awkward and he considered folding them or clasping his fingers behind his back. The silence was painful as he waited and still they had their eyes on him. Adan swallowed with difficulty, determined not to show his fear.<br><br>"You knew enough to tell me your name. Can you understand me?" Julius asked.<br><br>Adan worked spit into his dry mouth. "I can," he said. At least his voice hadn't quavered like a boy's. He squared his shoulders slightly and glanced at the others, almost recoiling from the naked animosity from one of them, a bear of a man with one arm who seemed to be practically growling with anger.<br><br>"You told the guards you were the one we were looking for, the one who killed the soldier," Julius said.<br><br>Adan's gaze snapped back to him. "I did it. I killed him," he replied, the words coming in a rush.<br><br>"You tortured him," Julius added.<br><br>Adan swallowed again. He had imagined this scene as he walked over the dark fields to the fort, but he couldn't summon the defiance he had pictured. He felt as if he were confessing to his father, and it was all he could do not to shuffle his feet in shame, despite his intentions.<br><br>"He was trying to rape my mother. I took him into the woods. She tried to stop me, but I would not listen to her," Adan said stiffly, trying to remember the words he had practiced.<br><br>Someone in the room muttered an oath, but Adan could not tear his eyes away from the general. He felt an obscure relief that he had told them. Now they would kill him and his parents would be released.<br><br>Thinking of his mother was a mistake. Tears sprang from nowhere to rim his eyes and he blinked them back furiously. She would want him to be strong in front of these men.<br><br>Julius watched him. The young Spaniard was visibly trembling, and with reason. He had only to give the order and Adan would be taken out into the yard and executed in front of the assembled ranks. It would be the end of it, but a memory stayed his hand.<br><br>"Why have you given yourself up, Adan?"<br><br>"My family have been taken in for questioning, General. They are innocent. I am the one you want."<br><br>"You think your death will save them?"<br><br>Adan hesitated. How could he explain that only that thin hope had made him come?<br><br>"They have done nothing wrong."<br><br>Julius raised a hand to scratch his eyebrow, then rested his elbow on the arm of the chair as he thought.<br><br>"When I was younger than you, Adan, I stood in front of a Roman named Cornelius Sulla. He had murdered my uncle and broken everything I valued in the world. He told me I would go free if I put aside my wife and shamed her with her father. He cherished such little acts of spite."<br><br>For a moment, Julius looked into the unimaginable distance of the past, and Adan felt sweat break out on his forehead. Why was the man talking to him? He had already confessed; there was nothing else. Despite his fear, he felt interest kindle. The Romans seemed to bear only one face in Spain. To hear they had rivalry and enemies within their own ranks was a revelation.<br><br>"I hated that man, Adan," Julius continued. "If I had been given a weapon, I would have used it on him even though it meant my own life. I wonder if you understand that sort of hatred."<br><br>"You did not give up your wife?" Adan asked.<br><br>Julius blinked at the sudden question, then smiled bitterly. "No. I refused and he let me live. The floor at his feet was spattered with the blood of people he had killed and tortured, yet he let me live. I have often wondered why."<br><br>"He did not think you were a threat," Adan said, surprised by his own courage to speak so to the general. Julius shook his head in memory.<br><br>"I doubt it. I told him I would devote my life to killing him if he set me free." For a moment, he almost said aloud how his friend had poisoned the Dictator, but that part of the story could never be told, not even to the men in that room.<br><br>Julius shrugged. "He died by someone else's hand, in the end. It is one of the regrets of my life that I could not do it ...</p><h2>Goombata: The Improbable Rise and Fall of John Gotti and His Gang</h2><p>The authors trace John Gotti&#39;s rise to power as the head of New York&#39;s Gambino crime family, offering a revealing inside look at the activities of the Mafia and at Gotti&#39;s struggle to the top of the criminal world</p><p>Gotti, the media's current Mafia superstar, is known as "the dapper don" for his expensive clothes and his flamboyant high profile. The authors, who last wrote The Heist (LJ 9/15/86), chronicle the ascent of Gotti and his buddies ( goombata ) from street hoodlums to leadership of New York City's Gambino crime family. This a fast-paced, readable story filled with the usual crimes, murders, vicious thuggery, and perversely comic incidents typical of organized crime. Gotti, who just was acquitted of his latest round of criminal charges, was also profiled in Mob Star by Gene Mustain and Jerry Capeci (Watts, 1988). Both books tell a similar tale, and those libraries without Mob Star may wish to add Goombata .<br><i>- Gregor A. Preston, Univ. of California Lib., Davis</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This brisk, no-holds-barred biography of Mafia boss John Gotti often makes The Godfather look tame. Gotti, recently acquitted of ordering the murder of a union official, is portrayed as a violent thug who worked his way up the mob's ranks, gaining expertise in contract murder, airport theft, hijacking, heroin trafficking, illegal gambling and extortion. In tracing Gotti's "perverse American success story"--his climb from young bookmaker stalking East Harlem in all-purple outfits to Gambino family boss--Cummings and Volkman (coauthors of The Heist ) also perform a biopsy of a social cancer, the modern Mafia.

But when Harlan meets and falls for a non-Eternal woman, he seeks to use the awesome powers and techniques of the Eternals to twist time for his own purposes, so that he and his love can survive together.</p><p>Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) was born in Russia and taken to America in 1923, becoming an American citizen in 1928. He took a degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1939, and took his MA in 1941 and his PhD in 1948, after spending the war years in the Naval Air Experimental Station. He joined the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949, becoming associate professor of biochemistry. He is best known for the Robot and Foundation sequences.<p>1. TECHNICIAN</p><p>Andrew Harlan stepped into the kettle. Its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above Harlan&#x2019;s head. Harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever.</p><p>The kettle did not move.</p><p>Harlan did not expect it to. He expected no movement; neither up nor down, left nor right, forth nor back. Yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch, though nonetheless immaterial for all that. And there was the little stir in his stomach, the faint (psychosomatic?) touch of dizziness, that told him that all the kettle contained, including himself, was rushing upwhen through Eternity.</p><p>He had boarded the kettle in the 575th Century, the base of operations assigned him two years earlier. At the time the 575th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled. Now he was moving upwhen to the 2456th Century.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect. His native Century was in the far downwhen, the 95th Century, to be exact. The 95th was a Century stiffly restrictive of atomic power, faintly rustic, fond of natural wood as a structural material, exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed. Although Harlan had not been in the 95th since he entered special training and became a Cub at the age of fifteen, there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from "home." At the 2456th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birth when and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened Eternal.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances all this would be so.</p><p>But right now Harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and tense, a little confused.</p><p>It was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper Century.</p><p>Strange that a Technician should feel tense or nervous about anything. What was it that Educator Yarrow had once said:</p><p>"Above all, a Technician must be dispassionate. The Reality Change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people. A million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals. Under these conditions, an emotional make-up is a distinct handicap."</p><p>Harlan put the memory of his teacher&#x2019;s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head. In those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position. But emotion had come upon him after all. Not for fifty billion people. What in Time did he care for fifty billion people? There was just one. One person.</p><p>He became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together, put himself into the cold, impersonal frame of mind a Technician must have, he stepped out. The kettle he left, of course, was not the same as the one he had boarded, in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms. He did not worry about that any more than any Eternal would. To concern oneself with the mystique of Time-travel, rather than with the simple fact of it, was the mark of the Cub and newcomer to Eternity.</p><p>He paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non-Space and non-Time which separated him from Eternity in one way and from ordinary Time in another.</p><p>This would be a completely new section of Eternity for him. He knew about it in a rough way, of course, having checked upon it in the Temporal Handbook. Still, there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment.</p><p>He adjusted the controls, a simple matter in passing into Eternity (and a very complicated one in passing into Time, a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent). He stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance. Automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>Only one man faced him. At first Harlan could see him only blurrily.</p><p>The man said, "I am Sociologist Kantor Voy. I imagine you are Technician Harlan."</p><p>Harlan nodded and said, "Father Time! Isn&#x2019;t this sort of ornamentation adjustable?"</p><p>Voy looked about and said tolerantly, "You mean the molecular films?"</p><p>"I certainly do," said Harlan. The Handbook had mentioned them, but had said nothing of such an insane riot of light reflection.</p><p>Harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable. The 2456th Century was matter-oriented, as most Centuries were, so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning. It would have none of the utter confusion (for anyone born matter-oriented) of the energy vortices of the 300&#x2019;s, or the field dynamics of the 600&#x2019;s. In the 2456th, to the average Eternal&#x2019;s comfort, matter was used for everything from walls to tacks.</p><p>To be sure, there was matter and matter. A member of an energy-oriented Century might not realize that. To him all matter might seem minor variations on the theme that was gross, heavy, and barbaric. To matter-oriented Harlan, however, there was wood, metal (subdivisions, heavy and light), plastic, silicates, concrete, leather, and so on.</p><p>But matter consisting entirely of mirrors!</p><p>That was his first impression of the 2456th. Every surface reflected and glinted light. Everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness; the effect of a molecular film. And in the ever-repeated reflection of himself, of Sociologist Voy, of everything he could see, in scraps and wholes, in all angles, there was confusion. Garish confusion and nausea!</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sorry," said Voy, "it&#x2019;s the custom of the Century, and the Section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical. You get used to it after a time."</p><p>Voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another Voy, upside down beneath the floor, who matched him stride for stride. He reached to move a hair-contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin.</p><p>The reflections died; extraneous light faded. Harlan felt his world settle.</p><p>"If you&#x2019;ll come with me now," said Voy.</p><p>Harlan followed through empty corridors that, Harlan knew, must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection, up a ramp, through an anteroom, into an office.</p><p>In all the short journey no human being had been visible. Harlan was so used to that, took it so for granted, that he would have been surprised, almost shocked, if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes. No doubt the news had spread that a Technician was coming through. Even Voy kept his distance and when, accidentally, Harlan&#x2019;s hand had brushed Voy&#x2019;s sleeve, Voy shrank away with a visible start.</p><p>Harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at this. He had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker, more efficiently insensitive than that. If he was wrong, if his shell had worn thinner, there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>No�s!</p><p>Sociologist Kantor Voy leaned forward toward the Technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion, but Harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table.</p><p>Voy said, "I am pleased to have a Technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here."</p><p>"Yes," said Harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him. "It has its points of interest." (Was he impersonal enough? Surely his real motives must be apparent, his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead.)</p><p>He removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected Reality Change. It was the very copy which had been sent to the Allwhen Council a month earlier. Through his relationship with Senior Computer Twissell (the Twissell, himself) Harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it.</p><p>Before unrolling the foil, letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field, Harlan paused a split moment.</p><p>The molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero. The motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the tabletop. He was thirty-two, but he looked older. He needed no one to tell him that. It might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the Technician in the minds of all Eternals. It might be just his own realization that he was a Technician.</p><p>But then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>"I am not a Sociologist, sir."</p><p>Voy smiled. "That sounds formidable. When one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field, it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately."</p><p>"No," said Harlan, "not an opinion. Just a request. I wonder if you won&#x2019;t look over this summary and see if you haven&#x2019;t made a small mistake somewhere here."</p><p>Voy looked instantly grave. "I hope not," he said.</p><p>Harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair, the other in his lap. He must let neither hand drum restless fingers. He must not bite his lips. He must not show his feelings in any way.</p><p>Ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself, he had been watching the summaries of projected Reality Changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the Allwhen Council. As Senior Computer Twissell&#x2019;s personally assigned Technician, he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics. Particularly with Twissell&#x2019;s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project. (Harlan&#x2019;s nostrils flared. He knew now a little of the nature of that project.)</p><p>Harlan had had no assurance that he woul...</p></p><h2>The Natural Pharmacy: Complete Home Reference to Natural Medicine</h2><p>Imagine having some of the most trusted and respected experts in natural medicine talk to you about your health concerns.

The love between team and borough was equally storied, an iron bond of loyalty forged through years of adversity and sometimes legendary ineptitude. Coming off their first World Series triumph ever in 1955, against the hated Yankees, the Dodgers would defend their crown against the Milwaukee Braves and the Cincinnati Reds in a six-month neck-and-neck contest until the last day of the playoffs, one of the most thrilling pennant races in history.<br><br>But as <i>The Last Good Season</i> so richly relates, all was not well under the surface. The Dodgers were an aging team at the tail end of its greatness, and Brooklyn was a place caught up in rapid and profound urban change. From a cradle of white ethnicity, it was being transformed into a racial patchwork, including Puerto Ricans and blacks from the South who flocked to Ebbets Field to watch the Dodgers&#x2019; black stars. The institutions that defined the borough &#x2013; the Brooklyn Eagle, the Brooklyn Navy Yard &#x2013; had vanished, and only the Dodgers remained. And when their shrewd, dollar-squeezing owner, Walter O&#x2019;Malley, began casting his eyes elsewhere in the absence of any viable plan to replace the aging Ebbets Field and any support from the all-powerful urban czar Robert Moses, the days of the Dodgers in Brooklyn were clearly numbered.<br><br>Michael Shapiro, a Brooklyn native, has interviewed many of the surviving participants and observers of the 1956 season, and undertaken immense archival research to bring its public and hidden drama to life. Like David Halberstam&#x2019;s <i>The Summer of &#x2019;49</i>, <i>The Last Good Season</i> combines an exciting baseball story, a genuine sense of nostalgia, and hard-nosed reporting and social thinking to reveal, in a new light, a time and place we only thought we understood.</p><p>"There are many things I could say about Michael Shapiro's engrossing book. But here's all you need to know before you pick it up and decide for yourself: It's about baseball. It's about Brooklyn. And it's dedicated to two guys named Lenny Wexler and Barney Karpfinger. What else do you need to know?"<br>-Bob Costas, NBC and HBO Sports<br>&#x201c;Michael Shapiro tells us the parallel tales of the Dodgers&#x2019; battle with the Braves for one last pennant and Walter O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s fight with Robert Moses for a new stadium in Brooklyn. In so doing, he proves once again that the Dodgers in the 1950s were just as compelling off the field as on. It&#x2019;s a fascinating story well told by a real fan.&#x201d;<br>-Ron Rapoport, Sports Columnist <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and sports commentator for NPR&#x2019;s &#x201c;Weekend Edition&#x201d;<br>"I read Michael Shapiro&#x2019;s <i>The Last Good Season</i> in one long fascinated sitting. He certainly did his homework, and I can honestly say that this book will satisfy those skeptical about the motives behind the Dodgers&#x2019;s move west. Furthermore, his account of the 1956 season reads like a novel, with a new twist or turn in every chapter."<br>-Buzzie Bavasi, former general manager of the Dodgers<br><b><br></b><br>"Michael Shapiro has written a wonderful book--it's about much more than the last season of a team of icons. Rather, it&#x2019;s about nothing less than the passing of an age in America."<br>- David Halberstam<br>"Thanks for the opportunity to read <i>The Last Good Season</i>. Michael Shapiro certainly writes wonderfully about the 1956 Dodgers, and I enjoyed every chapter. He has given the Brooklyn fans a much better insight into what Walter O'Malley was trying to do at that time--that he was truly trying to keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn. He also gives the reader the opportunity to understand what that great team itself was all about."<br>- Clem Labine, former Brooklyn Dodger<b>Michael Shapiro</b> was born in Brooklyn in 1952 and lives in New York City.

Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight's Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>This textbook series provides concise and lucid introductions to major works of literature, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century. Each book provides close reading of the text, as well as giving a full account of its historical, cultural and intellectual background, a discussion of its influence, and further reading.</p><h2>The Far Side of Eden: New Money, Old Land, and the Battle for Napa Valley</h2><p>James Conaway picks up the story begun a decade ago in his earlier book about Napa Valley, the premier American wine country and a place synonymous with the good life. By now the struggle over the valley&#x2019;s future has grown sharper and its success more glaring. Awash in dollars generated by the boom economy of the 1990s and the social ambitions it inspired, Napa is beset by too much of a good thing: new arrivals determined to have a vineyard of their own despite the fact that available land is running out, cult-wine producers in thrall to fabulously expensive &#x201c;rocket juice&#x201d; (cabernet sauvignon) that few locals can afford, established families wishing to hold on to the old ways, and camp followers caught up in the glamour of it all.<br>What has transformed a natural and agricultural beauty spot into a coveted global destination has left inevitable scars, and a small, impassioned band of environmentalists determine to resist further change. Alarmed by the wholesale felling of trees to make way for vines, the diminishment of the Napa River, and the decline in the health of the watershed, they strike back in a way rivets the valley and strongly divides the valley between those in favor of unbridled economic development and those insisting on limits.<br>Written by the author the New York Times credits with &#x201c;a Saroyan-like sense of humor and and Balzac-like eye for detail,&#x201d; The Far Side of Eden takes us to the frontlines of America&#x2019;s ongoing conflicts about money, land, and power to tell a tale that has ramifications for us all.</p><p>James Conaway, the author of nine previous books, is a contributing editor for Preservation and a regular contributor to Smithsonian, National Geographic Traveler, and Food &amp; Wine magazines, among many others.Prologue<br><br>At the south end of the valley, the Carneros hills roll in great earth swells <br>down toward San Pablo Bay, and at the north end the lowering presence of <br>Mount St. Helena sits like a cork in a bottle of opaque green glass.<br> The Napa River between these two points covers just thirty miles, <br>and the valley floor is only a couple of miles wide at its most commodious, <br>yet here, under skies oceanic in depth and color &#x2014; a blue impossible in <br>most of the world"s climes &#x2014; there occurred over the course of the <br>twentieth century something truly remarkable: agriculture withstood the <br>assault of development that overwhelmed the rest of this coveted bit of <br>California, and the product of that effort &#x2014; wine &#x2014; was made into a symbol of <br>privilege.<br> Meanwhile the valley, as is often said, became the envy of the <br>world. But in the last quarter century some of the idyllic character has <br>disappeared, and the valley, like the rest of the country, felt the pressure of <br>opposing views about what it should be and what it should look like. In the <br>1990s those tensions came forcefully into play here, and I was drawn to the <br>struggle in the belief that it embodied rudiments of the American character <br>and held clues about the future of the American landscape.<br> I had already written a book about Napa Valley, from research <br>done in the late 1980s, entitled Napa: The Story of an American Eden. I had <br>not been back for several years. When I did return I was surprised to find <br>many additional vineyards, more traffic, new mansions high in the rugged <br>but not inviolable hills, and a heightened sense of glamour; I also heard on all <br>sides contending views and strongly expressed expectations that each view <br>must prevail. Some people wanted only material prosperity, others only to <br>capture the moment in time, and these were clearly on a collision course.<br> I moved back for a time, the highway drawing me in like memory, <br>past the outskirts of the city of Napa in the south, into those broad <br>expanses of vineyard like unfurled bolts of corduroy planted also with houses <br>and recent manifestations of the booming tourist trade. I actually live on the <br>other side of the continent but here felt, in a way, that I was home, too, or at <br>least in some approximation of it: more than a tourist, less than a citizen.<br> I knew something of the valley"s history and topography, having <br>hiked in the bracketing, north-south&#x2013;trending mountains that to the <br>unknowing eye are secure in their ruggedness and isolation &#x2014; the <br>Mayacamas range on the west, dense with redwood and Douglas fir, <br>separates Napa and Sonoma valleys, and the Howell range on the east, <br>droughty, with a denser mix of chaparral amid the conifers, walls off the <br>farther reaches of Napa County &#x2014; and I knew that the valley supported <br>great biological diversity. In addition to some of the finest Vitis vinifera on <br>earth there was a good complement of California"s native oaks, steelhead <br>trout, deer, black bears, and a few spotted owls.<br> The valley"s story, like California"s, is essentially one of success, <br>but in my absence some volatile elements had been added to the human <br>mix, and they were potent indeed. The engines of commerce and <br>electronics had carried the country into the greatest hegemony in human <br>history, producing unimaginable new wealth, and a disproportionate amount <br>of it had found its way into the valley. At the same time, there had flowered a <br>school of protest with no roots in the commodity that had made the valley <br>famous and was in fact hostile to it. These two elements were new, and <br>already on the way to a showdown.<br> I found a place to live, in St. Helena, one of four "up-valley" towns: <br>a room with a bed and table, windows shielded by mock orange trees, a <br>sun-washed kitchen and a deck. There was a good restaurant just down the <br>block, but I used it infrequently. I listened to the sprinklers each night, and <br>awoke each morning to a fresh world, the exuberance of roses and mallows <br>lining the fence replaced by the smell of baked earth that is so Napan. A <br>few steps led to vineyards that surrounded the town and made available to <br>the lowliest visitor open, matchless vistas of mountains and sky.<br> The months I spent in that little house were happy and productive, <br>and I am grateful for them. It was the end of the nineties, that lost decade <br>so full of hope and opportunity, and it seemed to me, in that place, at that <br>time, that the future lay out there, just beyond the garden.<br> I still believe that what happened in Napa Valley is relevant to the <br>rest of the country, however altered now are our interior landscapes. How <br>people living in a contained, beautiful part of America dealt with threats to <br>established order is in large part what this book is about. The account is <br>factual, and it is important to note that the story isn"t over yet. In this new <br>century ideals share equal space only if they are lucky with hard global <br>reality; meanwhile, the valley"s fate is being fixed in the long weave of <br>ambition and desire, wealth and restraint, vines and the wildness of chosen <br>places.<br>I<br>A Vineyard of One"s Own <br><br>1<br><br>Something had happened, something momentous, something involving <br>money, lots of it &#x2014; what didn"t at century"s end? &#x2014; but more complicated <br>and subtle. It pervaded the lives of Americans considered blessed by any <br>standard, with houses close to some of the best restaurants on earth, the <br>value of their property on a near-vertically ascending plane, their views of a <br>gorgeous pastoral dream: mountains, agriculture as old as human history, <br>wild mustard blooming in the spring and, in autumn, the air perfumed by <br>fermenting wine as precious as that of Bordeaux, Burgundy, and <br>Champagne.<br> San Francisco lay just across a sparkling inland sea, but the <br>finest things could be had right here, too, at stations of the new cross &#x2014; <br>truffles at Sunshine Market, demi-glace at Dean &amp; DeLuca. Appetites were <br>enhanced by the best weather in a state famous for it, and the proximity of <br>visiting Hollywood and other sorts of stars imbued existence with a certain <br>frisson. And even if there were five million tourists a year to deal with, well, <br>those already here in the Napa Valley were the envy of all who weren"t.<br> Yet something was wrong. People disagreed over when "it" had <br>happened, and why, but not about the effect: a real, and growing, sense of <br>loss.<br> They felt it while sitting in a long line of cars on Highway 29, <br>looking up at once pristine slopes dense with conifer and chaparral, <br>studded now with "steroid houses," "muscle houses," "McMansions," all <br>contemptuous names for places built not to live in but as monuments to <br>finance, visited by absentee owners. The locals felt it overhearing <br>conversations about vanity vineyards, "cult" cabernets, and gardens <br>with "water features" to cover the traffic noise.<br> If they wanted to buy a house to actually live in, or to trade up, <br>they had to listen to sales pitches not about the valley"s illustrious history, <br>its neighborliness, schools, and churches, all the old-fashioned values, but <br>about the proximity of Tra Vigne and the French Laundry. If they owned a <br>house already, they had to wait for a carpenter or a plumber because these <br>tradesmen worked for the owners of the muscle houses or redone <br>Victorians, and then the locals had to pay fees often inflated by the presence <br>of so much outside money.<br> Worst of all, they had to listen to the stories. Many of these <br>featured limousines but were otherwise interchangeable. "I was pruning my <br>roses when this couple gets out," began one such account. "He"s got on <br>wraparound shades and a five-hundred-dollar shirt with not enough buttons, <br>bought in Beverly Hills, and she"s wearing haute safari from wherever."<br> The visitor might also be driving a new Lexus and looking nerdy in <br>pressed jeans and granny glasses, sure sign of a Silicon Valley weekender. <br>These were the young beneficiaries of the computer boom, and realtors <br>referred to them as "the children."<br> The procedure was much the same: "He says, "I"ll give you . . . ,"" <br>and here the figure varied among the millions, but was never less than one. <br>"I tell him the house isn"t for sale. He doubles the price. I have to go inside to <br>get away from him." Later, the visitor calls and triples the offer.<br> The problem was, many of the stories were true, like the one <br>about the house that sold for one-point-three, already an amazing sum for <br>such a modest place, and then the new owners "tweaked" the landscaping <br>&#x2014; added some exotics and a stone wall &#x2014; and sent to France for a <br>containerful of furniture. They put the house back on the market for two-point-<br>nine-five and received three instant offers for more. During escrow, an <br>unsuccessful bidder offered the buyer point-five just to step aside &#x2014; half a <br>million dollars to get out of the way.<br> There was the house listed for four, bought by a venture capitalist <br>who had seen it only once. Upon seeing it a second time, he decided he no <br>longer fancied it and resold the house at a half-million-dollar loss to a thirty-<br>five-year-old working in the acquisitions department of a major bank. And <br>there was the cottage in the town of St. Helena, listed for <br>point-nine-two-five, bid up to one-point-three. After that, everybody with a <br>three-room Victorian guesthouse with one and a half baths thought it was <br>worth one-point-three, and it was.<br> Houses that were not for sale were auctioned off without the <br>knowledge of the owners, who were presented with offers as faits <br>accomplis. Weekend guests bought their hosts" residences. One such couple<br>reportedly paid millions, first stipulating that everything had to be left as it <br>was, right down to the terrycloth bathrobes, since they didn"t want to be <br>bothered with purchasing their own things or didn"t know what was required. <br>Not that it mattered. Experts materialized to perform that function for the <br>newcomers, many of them living in San Francisco and tripping up on <br>commission. They advised on the creation of cunning archways, the buying <br>of period settees or Mayan urns, the planting of herb gardens "with a culinary <br>bias," the buying of wines from the Oakville Grocery, the joining of <br>Meadowood Country Club, the ordering of cut flowers from Tesoro"s, the <br>hiring of chefs and the vetting of maids and valets and the planting of the <br>ultimate symbol of success, more important even than a house &#x2014; a vineyard <br>of one"s own.<br> Everybody who mattered suddenly had to have one. This link to <br>ancient tradition was the latest, best way of transforming money into <br>status, though what the newcomers really wanted was a vineyard and "a <br>cabernet" made from its fruit that would be highly ranked by the critics and <br>set them miles ahead of other merely wealthy people. The locals couldn"t <br>afford these wines but had to listen to weekenders talk about them.<br> And they had to listen to the story about the woman with a <br>vineyard of her own who sold her mauve Bentley because it had no rack for <br>holding lattes, and the story about the couple building a glass house <br>containing smoke machines, and the story about another couple with <br>monogrammed toilet paper, each square resembling an illuminated <br>manuscript. You laughed at the stories, but they had an effect.<br> Life began to feel like a lottery, or like Renaissance Spain, the <br>gold ships coming in and their sails overshadowing all past custom and <br>convention. Their modern equivalent was the stretch limo, the pilot fish of <br>the nouveau riche lurking in restaurant parking lots and in the shade of olive <br>trees on landscaped lawns. Much of this bullion had been mined down in the <br>Santa Clara Valley, once lovely orchards since paved over and rechristened <br>with that unlovely moniker Silicon, symbol of the greatest economic <br>expansion in human history, a chemical that transmitted electronic impulses <br>and churned assets, changing the world, spinning off money to computer <br>whizzes and venture capitalists, dot-commers, "IPO sluts," entrepreneurs, <br>investment bankers, retailers, media- and consumer-related accumulators of <br>capital, all belted to the marvelous economic engine of the fading American <br>century. And not a few of them were disciples of personal gratification, and <br>self-serving.<br> And there were the speculators, a category to which every winery <br>owner and, in fact, many householders now belonged. That fact alone was <br>galling. With the acceptance of it came another realization, even sadder, <br>that in a few short years many longtime residents had gone from being <br>members of a community to serving as its adjuncts. So many of the big old <br>houses now belonged to outsiders the locals were unlikely to get to know, <br>and so eventually, it seemed, would all the valley. These old-timers would be <br>performing some service for the new people, if they weren"t already, even <br>though the locals were relatively rich on paper. If one of them sold a house <br>or a little vineyard, he couldn"t afford to buy another, not "up-valley." He <br>couldn"t compete at the wine auctions that raised money for the schools and <br>hospitals, couldn"t get a new kitchen countertop put in, couldn"t get a table <br>at Bistro Jeanty or even at Green Valley Caf� because of all the tourists <br>drawn by the celebrity.<br><br>Things were out of whack, not just in the real estate offices but also in the <br>hills. Out of sight, larger muscle houses were being built, and caves dug to <br>gargantuan dimensions to contain activities not related to wine, and <br>outlandish embellishments put in. There was the persistent story of a canal <br>built on a high dry ridge, complete with an operating lock and a barge that <br>could be boosted up and down, this in a fragile place where water was <br>scarce. Some people thought this a charming diversion, and others thought <br>it disgusting ego gratification and bad taste, but they didn"t say so because <br>for the most part people in the valley were accepting souls, polite, reluctant <br>to criticize.<br> This was just another story, no worse than the one about the <br>woman who moved from the Midwest to a house in the hills costing millions <br>so she could make cheese and sell it to the CIA &#x2014; the Culinary Institute of <br>America. Thus a substance once the byproduct of mere agriculture had <br>been elevated to a symbol of culture. For the first time in human history, <br>people were spending fortunes to make chump change and in the process be <br>associated with the most basic sort of enterprise &#x2014; agriculture &#x2014; which in <br>this incarnation had become glamorous. It made no more economic sense <br>than the muscle houses and vineyards on steep land where forest had <br>stood, and people marveled at the cost of it all. Planting those steep slopes <br>cost upward of a hundred thousand dollars an acre just to get the vines in, <br>not counting the purchase price, unjustifiable on the economics,...</p><h2>Farriers&#39; Lane</h2><p>"Gripping and intense...Her characters are authentically and appealingly drawn, and her plot is sinister."<br>BOOKLIST<br>When a distinguished judge dies of opium poisoning, the crucifixion five years before of Kingsley Blaine is brought back into the public eye, and it is screaming for revenge.

Now, in a new, globalized age, the Midwest is challenged as never before. With an influx of immigrant workers and an outpouring of manufacturing jobs, the region that defines the American self-the Lake Wobegon image of solid, hardworking farmers and factory hands-is changing at breakneck speed. As factory farms and global forces displace old ways of life, the United States is being transformed literally from the inside out. <br>In <i>Caught in the Middle</i>, longtime Chicago Tribune reporter Richard C. Longworth explores the new reality of life in today's heartland and reveals what these changes mean for the region-and the country. Ranging from the manufacturing collapse that has crippled the Midwest to the biofuels revolution that may save it, and from the school districts struggling with new migrants to the Iowa meatpacking town that can't survive without them, Longworth addresses what's right and what's wrong in the region, and offers a prescription for how it must change-politically as well as economically-if it is to survive and prosper.</p></p><p><p>Now a fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, <b>Richard C. Longworth </b>was an award-winning foreign correspondent and senior writer at the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. His previous book, <i>Global Squeeze</i>, was lauded by <i>Foreign Affairs </i>as "an engrossing study of how advanced societies grapple with the disruptive forces of global markets." Twice a Pulitzer Prize finalist, Longworth lives in Chicago.</p>Ex&#x2013;<i>Chicago Tribune</i> correspondent Longworth (<i>Global Squeeze</i>) paints a bleak, evocative portrait of the Midwest's losing struggle with foreign competition and capitalist gigantism. It's a landscape of shuttered factories, desperate laid-off workers, family farms gobbled up by agribusiness, once great cities like Detroit and Cleveland now in ruins, small towns devolved into depopulated rural slums haunted by pensioners and meth-heads. But the harshest element of the book is Longworth's own pitiless ideology of globalism. In his telling, Midwesterners are sluggish, unskilled, risk-averse mediocrities, clinging to obsolete industrial-age dreams of job security, allergic to change, indifferent to education and totally unfit for the global age. They are doomed because global competition is unstoppable, says Longworth, who dismisses the idea of trade barriers as simplistic nonsense purveyed by conspiracy theorists. The silver linings Longworth floats&#x2014;biotechnology, proposals for regional cooperation&#x2014;are meager and iffy. The Midwest's real hope, he insists, lies in a massive influx of mostly low-wage immigrant workers and in enclaves of the rich and brainy, like Chicago and Ann Arbor, where the creative class sells nebulous information solutions to dropouts and Ph.D.s. It's not the Middle West that's under siege in Longworth's telling; it's the now apparently quaint notion of a middle class. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What few people realize, however, is that Reagan's revolution did not begin when he took office in 1980, but in his failed presidential challenge to Gerald Ford in 1975-1976. This is the remarkable story of that historic campaign-one that, as Reagan put it, turned a party of "pale pastels" into a national party of "bold colors." Featuring interviews with a myriad of politicos, journalists, insiders, and observers, Craig Shirley relays intriguing, never-before-told anecdotes about Reagan, his staff, the campaign, the media, and the national parties and shows how Reagan, instead of following the lead of the ever-weakening Republican party, brought the party to him and almost single-handedly revived it.</p></p><p>The campaign for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination is the only political race that Ronald Reagan ever lost. Ironically, that defeat to Gerald Ford "changed the conservative movement, the Republican Party, America, and eventually the world," writes Craig Shirley in <i>Reagan's Revolution</i>. Further, the campaign "marked the point when conservatives took over the Republican Party and changed its message and its ideology." Reagan's views on such issues as tax cuts, aggressive anti-Communism, reductions in government spending, and the use of military power to protect American interests moved from radical ideas to part of the Republican platform after 1976. Tracing Reagan's rise to national power to the concession speech he made at the convention, Shirley explains in great detail how Reagan almost single-handedly took the Republican Party from its "death throes" to its resurgence. He may have lost the nomination, but he saved the party. Based on interviews with insiders who worked on the campaign and the journalists and pundits who covered it, <i>Reagan's Revolution</i> offers many telling anecdotes and fascinating insights into the race's build-up and conclusion, making it the first book to offer exhaustive coverage of this vital period in Reagan's life. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i>"All in all, Shirley's work has much to commend it. His book should be read by anyone interested in Reagan, the rise of conservatism in the Republican Party, or American politics in the mid-1970's."--<b>Andrew E. Busch</b>, <i>Claremont Review of Books</i>"Craig Shirley's account will be an indispensible resource for anybody who wants to understand just how Mr. Reagan lost and why his defeat set the stage for victory four years later, upending history's supposed dialectic."--<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>"He tells the story of a losing campaign that may have saved the country, and he does it well."--<b>Robert D.

It is a story of tremendous courage, astonishing achievement and heart-breaking loss. Their leader was the boyish, fanatically driven Chris Bonington. His inner circle &#x2014; which came to be known as Bonington&#x2019;s Boys &#x2014; included a dozen who became climbing&#x2019;s greatest generation. Bonington&#x2019;s Boys gave birth to a new brand of climbing. They took increasingly terrible risks on now-legendary expeditions to the world&#x2019;s most fearsome peaks. And they paid an enormous price for their achievements. Most of Bonington&#x2019;s Boys died in the mountains, leaving behind the hardest question of all: Was it worth it?<br><br><i>The Boys of Everest,</i> based on interviews with surviving climbers and other individuals, as well as five decades of journals, expedition accounts, and letters, provides the closest thing to an answer that we&#x2019;ll ever have. It offers riveting descriptions of what Bonington's Boys found in the mountains, as well as an understanding of what they lost there.<br></p><p>Clint Willis has published more than forty books, including anthologies on topics such as adventure, politics, relgion, and war. His work has appeared in hundreds of publications, including Men&#39;s Journal, Outside, and the New York Times. His work has also been nominated for the American Society of Magazine Editors&#39; National Magazine Award.With nowhere to go but down after the 1953 conquest of Mt. Everest, mountain climbing was reinvigorated by the group of young British daredevils celebrated in this gripping adventure saga. Journalist and mountain-climber Willis (<i>Epic</i>) profiles elder statesman Bonington and such climbing legends as the truculent working-class prodigy Don Whillan, the austere ex-seminarian Joe Tasker and the perpetually brooding Dougal Haston, "a beatnik's idea of a Romance poet." Their ethos of anti-establishment authenticity drove them to extreme climbs in which smaller teams working with minimal gear tackled harder routes under riskier conditions. Willis narrates almost step-by-step retracings of their ascents; they dodge falling rocks, freeze and hallucinate, dangle from fraying ropes and slip heart-stoppingly into crevasses. (Some of this detail, like the reconstructions of the last thoughts of men who died on the mountain, must be imagined rather than factual.) Less compelling are the many poetic evocations of the existential mystery of climbing&#x2014;"a pilgrimage, an act of faith that arose from a sense of their own emptiness"&#x2014;which add little to the standard "Because it's there." Fortunately, the spiritual musings don't obscure the bracing immediacy of Willis's story of life spent teetering on the edge of the abyss.

My long opiate-dazed days and sleepless nights were all about cutting myself emotionally. When I got high, the last thing in the world I wanted to do was party or interact with other human beings.

Thompson</h2><p><p><strong>"Gets it all in: the boozing and drugging...but also the intelligence, the loyalty, the inherent decency." &#x2015;Jonathan Yardley, <em>Washington Post</em></strong></p><p>Hunter S. Thompson detonated a two-ton bomb under the staid field of journalism with his magazine pieces and revelatory <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em>. In <em>Outlaw Journalist</em>, the famous inventor of Gonzo journalism is portrayed as never before. Through in-depth interviews with Thompson&#x2019;s associates, William McKeen gets behind the drinking and the drugs to show the man and the writer&#x2015;one who was happy to be considered an outlaw and for whom the calling of journalism was life.</p> 16 pages of photographs</p><p>William McKeen, chair of the journalism department at Boston University, has written or edited thirteen books including Outlaw Journalist, Highway 61, and Everybody Had an Ocean.<p>Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley </p><p> Hunter Stockton Thompson, who took his own life three years ago at the age of 67, was a superbly gifted and original prose stylist who wanted to be a novelist but, failing in that, settled for journalism. He was scarcely the first to follow that course, but similarities to others end just about there. While most failed novelists turn their talents to reportage or commentary or criticism, Thompson simply turned journalism on its head. He was frequently pigeonholed with Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese and others among the founders during the 1960s of the New Journalism, but he was strictly a one-man band whose writing defied imitation or even parody. </p><p>He called it "gonzo," though the term didn't originate with him. William McKeen tells us in Outlaw Journalist that it was coined in 1970 by a friend of Thompson's named Bill Cardoso. After reading a magazine article by Thompson called "The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved," Cardoso told Thompson: "I don't know what . . . you're doing, but you've changed everything. It's totally gonzo." McKeen goes on to explain: "Gonzo. Perhaps derived from the French Canadian gonzeaux. The word had a couple of different meanings, but Bill Cardoso used it in the Boston-bar derivation, referring to the last man standing after a night of drinking. Gonzo had a nice ring." </p><p>Indeed it did, and Thompson happily embraced it for the remaining three-and-a-half decades of his certifiably wild and crazy life. That article, published in a now-defunct magazine called Scanlan's and accompanied by drawings by the British artist Ralph Steadman, "provided Hunter his epiphany," permitting him not merely to place himself at the center of his narrative -- that was rapidly becoming a commonplace of the New Journalism, usually in the service of narcissism rather than journalism -- but also to transform himself into an almost mythic character. "Praising the article," McKeen writes, "Tom Wolfe celebrated Hunter's 'manic, highly-adrenal first-person style.' Putting the writer center stage was not always a good idea, Wolfe said, but it worked because Hunter usually casts himself as a 'frantic loser, inept and half-psychotic, somewhat after the manner of Celine' and because much of the Derby description comes 'in the form of Celine-like fantasies he presents to the artist, Ralph Steadman, in conversation.' " </p><p>That Thompson's breakthrough came in an article about the Kentucky Derby was coincidental yet apt, because he was a native of Louisville whose childhood there had been happy -- even though he "was a difficult child" who from the outset "had issues with authority" -- and who kept in touch throughout his life with many of his boyhood friends and accomplices in juvenile rebellion. He was the oldest of Jack and Virginia Thompson's three sons. The family lived on the periphery of Louisville's Old Dixie aristocracy, leaving Hunter with ambiguous feelings toward wealth and social position that he was never able to shake. He turned into the classic American outsider, his nose pressed against the glass, half longing to be inside, half despising everything and everyone he saw there. It is a vantage point from which much of the best American fiction has been written -- for starters, take The Great Gatsby -- but though Thompson did write one novel, The Rum Diary, he drifted into journalism instead, by way of the Air Force. </p><p>He began as a sportswriter for the base newspaper at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida in 1956 and did well at it, but his problems with authority surfaced -- predictably -- and within a year his supervising colonel wrote: "The Airman, although talented, will not be guided by policy or personal advice and guidance. Sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airman staff members. He has little consideration for military bearing or dress and seems to dislike the service and want out as soon as possible." He got his wish in November 1957 -- somewhat incredibly, he managed to pull off an honorable discharge -- and immediately headed for New York, beginning a pattern of only intermittently remunerative vagabond journalism that persisted throughout his life. </p><p>His first important step forward came in 1962, when he began a freelance relationship with the National Observer, a Sunday newspaper published under the aegis of the Wall Street Journal. Though it never managed to find an audience and eventually went under, in many respects it was a good newspaper, more open to distinctive writing than most established newspapers of the day. Thompson wrote a number of pieces for it from Latin America and then the States, and "took pride in being part of the publication," but for reasons that remain unclear he "stopped working for the Observer by the summer of 1965." He had made a bit of a name for himself as a writer, but also as difficult to deal with and frequently strung out on alcohol and/or the many drugs that became his treasured companions as his life progressed. </p><p>He was into LSD by the summer of 1965, mescaline by 1968, cocaine by 1973, and he was always into booze: "He drank a lot -- probably enough during a twenty-four-hour span to render a minor-league infield unconscious. But he could hold his liquor. Longtime friends could remember only seeing him truly out-of-control drunk two or maybe three times during the course of a forty-year friendship. His fans knew the character, not the man, and when they approached him, they often felt the need to affect being high if they weren't already. They had assumed Hunter would want them that way. But he hated sloppy, inarticulate drunks. He breakfasted on bloody marys and beer and drank Wild Turkey and Chivas by the tumbler, but he was rarely [drunk]." </p><p>If the National Observer was his first important outlet, he made his name and built his legend after he began writing for Rolling Stone in 1970. This was while the counterculture magazine was still young, still based in San Francisco, still noted primarily for "intelligent writing about popular music." By then in his early 30s, Thompson was older than many of the magazine's contributors and more connected to Bob Dylan than to the Rolling Stones, but he was wholly in tune with its rebellious spirit, and he had at last found a place where his evolving prose style -- wildly off-the-wall, intensely personal yet in no way narcissistic, laced with obscenities -- was not merely tolerated but applauded. In November 1971 Rolling Stone published the two long pieces that eventually became his best and most famous book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and in the years to come most of his best work appeared there. He had a turbulent relationship with the magazine, especially its founding editor, Jann Wenner, but it was there that his collaboration with Ralph Steadman began and there that he metamorphosed from Thompson the journalist to Thompson the legend. </p><p>This occurred within the pages of the magazine and, much to Thompson's dismay, in newspapers all over the country that published Garry Trudeau's comic strip, "Doonesbury." In December 1974 Trudeau introduced "Uncle Duke," a "balding, aviator-shade-wearing Rolling Stone writer who hallucinated that he was seeing bats," which is exactly what Thompson does in the opening paragraph of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. "For Hunter," McKeen writes, "it was a nightmare of celebrity coming true. . . . 'When you're a famous American writer, you don't think of things like being in the comic strips,' he said. 'Being a cartoon character in your own time is like having a second head.' " Eventually, though, he became imprisoned by this image, and as he wrote less and less, he let the image blend into reality. His first wife, Sandy, who probably knew and understood him better than anyone, got it right: </p><p>"He was a tortured tragic figure. I do not think that he was a great writer. I think he clearly had great potential, both as a writer and a leader. However, he fell -- dramatically and a very, very long time ago. Hunter wanted to be a great writer and he had the genius, the talent, and, early on, the will and the means. He was horrified by whom [sic] he had become and ashamed -- or I really should say tortured. He knew he had failed. He knew that his writing was absolutely not great. This was part of the torture. And yet, he could never climb back. The image, the power, the drugs, the alcohol, the money . . . all of it . . . he never became that great American writer he had wanted to be. Nowhere close. And he knew it." </p><p>This is an unsparing judgment, perhaps somewhat influenced by the menial role Sandy played throughout their marriage, but it is fair, and to his credit McKeen publishes it with obvious sympathy. A professor of journalism at the University of Florida, he is susceptible to moments of Hunter-worship -- his preface is an embarrassment -- but manages to tell Thompson's story in a straightforward way. Certainly, he gets it all in: the boozing and drugging, the histrionics, the womanizing, the violence, but also the intelligence, the loyalty, the inherent decency. Over the long haul, Thompson won't be much more than a footnote in American literary history, but in his day he set off plenty of explosions, and he was a lot of fun to watch. At his best, he was even more fun to read. </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

But in the wake of 9/11, Smiley faltered in her hitherto unflagging impulse to write and decided to approach novels from a different angle: she read one hundred of them, from classics such as the thousand-year-old <i>Tale of Genji</i> to recent fiction by Zadie Smith, Nicholson Baker, and Alice Munro.<br><br>Smiley explores&#x2013;as no novelist has before her&#x2013;the unparalleled intimacy of reading, why a novel succeeds (or doesn&#x2019;t), and how the novel has changed over time. She describes a novelist as &#x201c;right on the cusp between someone who knows everything and someone who knows nothing,&#x201d; yet whose &#x201c;job and ambition is to develop a theory of how it feels to be alive.&#x201d; <br><br>In her inimitable style&#x2013;exuberant, candid, opinionated&#x2013;Smiley invites us behind the scenes of novel-writing, sharing her own habits and spilling the secrets of her craft. She walks us step-by-step through the publication of her most recent novel, <i>Good Faith, </i>and, in two vital chapters on how to write &#x201c;a novel of your own,&#x201d; offers priceless advice to aspiring authors.&nbsp; <br><br><i>Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel </i>may amount to a peculiar form of autobiography.&nbsp;We see Smiley reading in bed with a chocolate bar; mulling over plot twists while cooking dinner for her family; even, at the age of twelve, devouring Sherlock Holmes mysteries, which she later realized were among her earliest literary models for plot and character.<br><br>And in an exhilarating conclusion, Smiley considers individually the one hundred books she read, from <i>Don Quixote </i>to <i>Lolita </i>to <i>Atonement, </i>presenting her own insights and often controversial opinions.&nbsp;In its scope and gleeful eclecticism, her reading list is one of the most compelling&#x2013;and surprising&#x2013;ever assembled. <br><br>Engaging, wise, sometimes irreverent, <i>Thirteen Ways</i> is essential reading for anyone who has ever escaped into the pages of a novel or, for that matter, wanted to write one. In Smiley&#x2019;s own words, ones she found herself turning to over the course of her journey: &#x201c;Read this. I bet you&#x2019;ll like it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane Smiley is the author of eleven novels as well as three works of nonfiction. She is the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize and was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2001. Smiley lives in Northern California.What Is a Novel?<br><br> SIMPLICITY<br><br> An inexpensive paperback book from a reputable publisher is a small, rectangular, boxlike object a few inches long, a few inches wide, and an inch or so thick. It is easy to stack and store, easy to buy, keep, give away, or throw away. As an object, it is user-friendly and routine, a mature technological form, hard to improve upon and easy to like. Many people, myself among them, feel better at the mere sight of a book. As I line up my summer reading of thirty-four novels written in the twentieth century, I realize that I have gained so much and such reliable pleasure from so many novels that my sense of physiological well-being (heart rate, oxygenation, brain chemical production) noticeably improves as I look at them. I smile. This row of books elevates my mood.<br><br> The often beautiful cover of a book opens like the lid of a box, but it reveals no objects, rather symbols inscribed on paper. This is simple and elegant, too. The leaves of paper pressed together are reserved and efficient as well as cool and dry. They protect each other from damage. They take up little space. Spread open, they offer some information, but they don't offer too much, and they don't force it upon me or anyone else. They invite perusal. Underneath the open leaves, on either side, are hidden ones that have been read or remain to be read. The reader may or may not experience them. The choice is always her own. The book continues to be an object. Only while the reader is reading does it become a novel.<br><br> But it turns out that a novel is simple, too. A novel is a (1) lengthy, (2) written, (3) prose, (4) narrative with a (5) protagonist. Everything that the novel is and does, every effect that the novel has had on, first, Western culture, and subsequently, world culture, grows out of these five small facts that apply to every novel.<br><br> The longest novels that stand alone in one volume are just under 1,000 pages--Henry Fielding's Tom Jones* would be a good example. The shortest run under 100 pages--Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness would define that end of the continuum. Most novels run 300 to 400 pages, or 100,000 to 175,000 words. If a competent reader can read 30 or 40 pages in an hour--that is, 12,000 to 20,000 words--then most novels take ten hours to read. Length is a bland and reassuring quality, but it is no blander or more reassuring than any of the other qualities. Prose, for example, is usually simpler to read and more casual than poetry. We are accustomed to reading prose, and we talk in a sort of prose. Narrative, too, is a natural form. People tell stories from their earliest years and continue to narrate as long as they can remember and care about sequences of events. Almost always, their stories have themselves or their friends as protagonists. A story requires a protagonist--that is, a human or a humanlike consciousness who acts or is acted upon in the course of the story. Most people with the normal brain development and structure that results in a sense of self live with a protagonist every minute of every day, and that protagonist--"one who feels (agon) for (pro)"--is himself or herself. A protagonist is the most natural thing in the world.<br><br> Every novel has all of these elements. If any of them is missing, the literary form in question is not a novel. All additional characteristics--characters, plot, themes, setting, style, point of view, tone, historical accuracy, philosophical profundity, revolutionary or revelatory effect, pleasure, enlightenment, transcendence, and truth--grow out of the ironclad relationships among these five elements. A novel is an experience, but the experience takes place within the boundaries of writing, prose, length, narrative, and protagonist.<br><br> The most necessary of the five qualities of the novel is writing. The paradox of writing is that it is permanent, and so it may be forgotten. Author and reader agree that images and ideas set down in writing may come and go because they do not have to be stored in memory. Hazy notions and vague pictures that have to do with the writing certainly remain in the memories of both author and reader, as do strong emotional impressions that author and reader alike feel upon reading certain sections of the novel, but exact wordings can be largely forgotten. The same is not true of poetry. A poem must be remembered word for word or it loses its identity. In fact, poetry is often learned and remembered word for word, as when students memorize Hamlet's famous soliloquy ("Who would these fardels bear?") in spite of the fact that they have only the dimmest idea of what the words mean. The words may have the power of an incantation even in the absence of comprehension. The memory, though, sets limits upon what is to be remembered. The history of epic poetry, for example, shows that poets used set forms, rhythm, rhyme, figures of speech, and already familiar stories as mnemonic devices to aid in both the composition and the transmission of poetry from poet to poet and from poet to audience. Novelists have no need to do so. Particular stylistic tricks or turns of phrase are not necessary as mnemonic aids to the continued existence of the novel, and so the author is free to explore language and ideas that are hard to remember in detail. The novelist can go on and on, adding scenes, ideas, characters, complexities of every sort, knowing that they are safe from the effects of human memory--they will exist forever exactly as printed and will not evolve by passing through the faulty memories of others.<br><br> Writing allows the elaboration of prose. Since memorization is unlikely to begin with, it may be made all the more unlikely by the use of a style that is unmemorable. Prose slips by, common as water. Readers have no defense against it other than boredom. But because it is so common and often colorless, the writer can use it in many ways, from the blandest, most objective, reportlike purposes to the most vivid, evocative, lyrical purposes. James Joyce and Virginia Woolf famously exploited metaphorical and lyrical possibilities of English prose that Defoe and Trollope did not. Prose may slow down and quicken, invoke and state, flower into figures of speech, flatten into strings of facts, observations, assertions. It may pile detail upon detail or summarize years of action in a few pages (as in the middle section of To the Lighthouse). Prose usually privileges the sentence, using punctuation to define the beginnings, endings, and complications of thoughts, and sentences are easy. They are what we learn and, often, how we learn it. Even though we don't use them in speech as much as we think we do (in fact, people who talk in whole sentences are generally thought of as pedantic or "prosy"), when our thoughts assume formal shape, they organize themselves into sentences. Poetry, in its search for concentration and sharp effect, contracts. In prose, one thought leads to another--it expands. Although thoughtless expansion is a fault to be guarded against, inspired expansion gives us the novels of Proust and Tolstoy, or Laurence Sterne and Halldor Laxness. Prose is both sneaky and powerful, and is naturally narrative, since sequences of events have some inherent organization, and it is naturally expansive, since events can often be broken down into smaller events and extended backward and forward in time.<br><br> In Aspects of the Novel, E. M. Forster writes of narrative--that is, of "what happened then?"--almost with contempt. Even the lowliest bus driver, Forster says, could show an interest in suspense, in a sequence of events. He almost admits to wishing that novels could be written without narrative, without what he seems to think is the lowest common denominator of art. But they can't be. It is not only that the novel was invented to tell a lengthy and complicated story that could not be told in any other way, it is also that without the spine of narrative logic and suspense, it cannot be sufficiently organized to be understandable to the reader. Even more basically, a sequence of sentences, which is the only form sentences can occur in, must inevitably result in a narrative. The very before-and-after qualities of written sentences imply, mimic, and require the passage of time. There are minimally narrative novels, but the more lyrical and less narrative a novel is, the shorter it is, until it becomes a short story, which may, indeed, dispense almost entirely with narrative and become a series of impressions or linguistic effects or rhetorical flourishes, as happened with American short stories in the 1960s and 1970s. Narratives are as common as prose; they are the way humans have chosen to pack together events and emotions, happenings in the world and how they make us feel. Even the most informal narratives alternate what happens and how it feels (or what it means) to some degree. Even the most formally objective narratives (such as police reports) imply the emotions that rise out of the events, when at the same time they are suspending conclusions as to the meanings of the events.<br><br> Because narrative is so natural, efficient, and ubiquitous, it, like prose, can be used in myriad ways. The time sequence can be abused however the writer wishes to abuse it, because the human tendency, at least in the West, to think in sequence is so strong that the reader will keep track of beginning, middle, and end on her own. Nevertheless, the commonest bus driver can and often does take an interest in what happens next, and so because the novel requires narrative for organization, it will also be a more or less popular form. It can never exclude bus drivers completely, and is, therefore, depending on one's political and social views, either perennially compromised or perennially inclusive.<br>...</p><h2>Della Fattoria Bread: 63 Foolproof Recipes for Yeasted, Enriched &amp; Naturally Leavened Breads</h2><p><p>Bread is one of the most fundamental parts of our diet, yet so many of us rely on bland grocery-store offerings when flavorsome breads can easily be made at home. <i>Della Fattoria Bread</i> teaches readers to make the popular breads of this award-winning bakery.

Now Davis has collected almost 500 new images in this first of a two-volume set. What distinguishes this venture is Davis's perspective. Previous photographic histories focused almost exclusively on the men and machinery of war. As well as these subjects, Davis includes sections on the physical landscape, a Yankee photographer in the South, and postwar reunions of ex-soldiers. Davis's new "portrait" brings in the civilian side and reveals the photographers' craft well enough to recommend it as a good, short introduction to Civil War photographic records, but the Image of War remains a better investment for university and public libraries.

For Teacher&#39;s Guides (including common core tie-ins) and more, visit MarianneMalone.com.The Sixty-Eight Rooms Adventure series blends multiple topics of fascination to many a reader: miniaturization (think The Borrowers), time travel (think the Magic Tree House), mystery (think Hardy Boys), and secretly trawling a museum behind the scenes (think From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler). In this third outing, Jack&#x2019;s ancestor, from whom he inherits a gold coin, was apparently a seagoing man, and the coin appears to be connected to the adventures the kids have when they make themselves small enough to stroll though the doll-sized, historically decorated Thorne Rooms at Chicago&#x2019;s Art Institute. The mystery of the coin, and another involving Phoebe, a slave girl the friends met in a previous outing, reveal a new facet of the rooms&#x2019; importance: as repositories for vital artifacts. Retrieving one for a classmate related to Phoebe becomes the duo&#x2019;s mission, even as they discover unwanted consequences. Intriguing, and with enough loose ends to entice readers to further installments, this remains a standout series.

Visit him online at PascalLemaitre.com.Kindergarten-Grade 5-Rhythmic verse, comic-strip panels, and a bug-populated city are the main elements in this modern twist on an Aesop fable. Kid A, an ant, leaves his grasshopper friend, Foxy G, to return to work: "Got to split, Foxy. The summer's been fun. Time to dump this place, get back in the race. There's a lot of work to be done." Foxy stays on the streets ("I have to groove, move, prove, disprove-") to play music "clear and wild." When the grasshopper's wings freeze, he shamefully goes to the ant's door. Recalling Leo Lionni's Frederick (Knopf, 1967), Foxy argues that "art is work/It just looks like play," but his friend rejects him. Strong rhythms and occasional use of slang match the jazzy world depicted in the artwork. Some rhymes seem forced, but in general the poetry is effective, flowing through narration and dialogue. The handwritten cursive text may be challenging for younger readers. Lemaitre's cartoons help with the story's pace, and the switch from small panels to full-page scenes effectively accentuates dramatic moments. The book ends with two wordless illustrations, one showing a not-so-sure-of-himself ant, opposite a look at the grasshopper trudging through the snow. A final scene repeats the grasshopper view, this time depicted as a snow globe, with the phrase "Who's Got Game?" underneath. Readers drawn into the initially lighthearted tale are neatly led to a conclusion that encourages them to ponder and discuss the value and importance of art.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bakery Restaurant Cookbook</h2><p>A well-known chef reveals the unique recipes used at his popular Chicago restaurant and his personal cooking secrets, which make each dish turn out perfect</p><p></p><h2>For The Tough Times: Reaching Toward Heaven for Hope</h2><p><p><strong>When we feel that life is out of control, He is in control.</strong></p><p>When tragedy strikes, people desperately search for answers.

In this book, Heather Arndt Anderson explores the many ways nature has attempted to take the roofs of our mouths off&#x2014;from the deceptively vegetal-looking jalapeno to the fire-red ghost pepper&#x2014;and the many ways we have gleefully risen to the challenge.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anderson tells the story of the spicy berry&#x2019;s rise to prominence, showing that it was cultivated and venerated by the ancient people of Mesoamerica for millennia before Spanish explorers brought it back to Europe. She traces the chilli&#x2019;s spread along trading routes to every corner of the globe, and she explores the many important spiritual and cultural links that we have formed with it, from its use as an aphrodisiac to, in more modern times, an especially masochistic kind of eating competition. Ultimately, she uses the chili to tell a larger story of global trade, showing how the spread of spicy cuisine can tell us much about the global exchange&#x2014;and sometimes domination&#x2014;of culture. Mixing history, botany, and cooking, this entertaining read will give your bookshelf just the kick it needs.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Heather Arndt Anderson </b>is a Portland, Oregon&#x2013;based food writer, culinary historian, and botanist, as well as a regular panelist on the podcast <i>The Four Top</i>.

Renowned food writer Anderson provides an authoritative, thorough, well-researched, readable history of chili peppers, their discovery by Europeans, their use in the Americas, and their utilization in European, Asian, African, and Latin American food cultures and medicinal traditions. The author speaks to the great diversity of chili peppers, the Scoville scale to measure heat, and the reasons chili peppers, though painful for some, have become so pleasurable to millions around the world. On a graver note, the book also speaks to the broader picture of globalization and world trade, making ambitious parallels between the exchange of New World foodstuffs for colonization, slavery, and European cultural domination. Plentiful illustrations from historical documents, herbals, travel documents, and cookbooks complement the volume, along with a section of recipes and a list of organizations that promote the use of chili peppers.

Her first book, The Plutonium Files, was the recipient of two PEN Awards in 2000.In the early morning of March 9, 1916, Pancho Villa launched an attack on Columbus, N.Mex., that cost the lives of 18 American civilians and soldiers. The American government responded by dispatching troops, led by Gen. John Pershing, into Mexico in pursuit of Villa, while tensions continued to escalate between the two countries, bringing them to the point of war. Despite its title, this book is more concerned with the Columbus attack itself&#x2014;as well as its root causes and general aftermath&#x2014;than it is with Pershing's hunt for the perpetrator. A Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist, Welsome approaches her subject with a novelistic eye for character and minutiae, devoting as much care to describing Villa's eyes as she does to his military philosophy. These digressive flourishes lend a raw humanism to her account of the attack, which plays as a series of horrifying vignettes and serves as the book's centerpiece. In the pages that follow, Welsome's anecdotal style occasionally saps the text's momentum. Overall, the vivid attention to detail compensates for whatever the narrative lacks in focus or efficiency. <i>(June 2)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Joseph Henderson considers archetypes to be predictable patterns of inner conditioning that lead to certain essential changes and shows the parallels between individual psychological self-development and the rites that marked initiation in the past. Dr. Henderson&#x2019;s topics include the uninitiated; return of the mother; remaking a man; trial by strength; the rite of vision; thresholds of initiation; initiation and the principle of ego-development in adolescence; and initiation in the process of individuation. This is essential reading for an understanding of the universal nature of initiation, especially as it relates traditional initiatory practices to Jung&#x2019;s theory of archetypes.</p><p>Joseph L. Henderson, M.D., began his analysis with C.G. Jung in 1929 and continued to work with Jung until 1938, when he completed his medical training at St. Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital, London. In 1941, he moved to San Francisco and began his psychiatric and analytic practice. Dr. Henderson was one of the founders of the Society of Jungian Analysts of Northern California (1950), and for the past 53 years he has been an important teacher and training analyst to several generations of analysts.Henderson&#x2019;s careful, scholarly approach is displayed to good effect in this wide-ranging volume. -- <i>Journal of Analytical Psychology</i></p><h2>Anders Nygren (Makers of the modern theological mind)</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

Shuichi spends a precious gift of cash from his grandmother on a special present for himself, a purchase that triggers a chain of events in which his sister Maho learns his secret, and Shuichi inadvertently steals the heart of a boy Maho in interested in. <br><br> The woman who showed so much interest in Yoshino (when she was wearing a boy&#x2019;s school uniform) in volume one reappears with her boyfriend, and becomes a mentor and friend to the two children. And the kids go on a class trip that is a rite of passage Shuichi would rather pass up. Shuichi is called a &#x201c;faggot&#x201d; by another boy, and the dramatic nature in which Saori comes to Shuichi&#x2019;s defense leads the two to discover a shared fondness for <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>.

This was the first indication that he had been created as a slave.<br><br>Unlike God, Victor Frankenstein saw no value in giving his creations free will. Like all utopians, he preferred obedience to independent thought.<br><br>That night, over two hundred years in the past, had set a theme of madness and violence that characterized Deucalion's life for years thereafter. Despair had fostered rage. In his rages, he had killed, and savagely.<br><br>These many decades later, he had learned self-control. His pain and loneliness had taught him pity, whereafter he learned compassion. He had found his way to hope.<br><br>Yet still, on certain nights, without immediate cause, anger overcomes him. For no rational reason, the anger swells into a tidal rage that threatens to sweep him beyond prudence, beyond discretion.<br><br>This night in New Orleans, Deucalion walked an alleyway on the perimeter of the French Quarter, in a mood to murder. Shades of gray, of blue, of black were enlivened only by the crimson of his thoughts.<br><br>The air was warm, humid, and alive with muffled jazz that the walls of the famous clubs could not entirely contain.<br><br>In public, he stayed in shadows and used back streets, because his formidable size made him an object of interest. As did his face.<br><br>From the darkness beside a Dumpster, a wrinkled rum-soaked raisin of a man stepped forth. "Peace in Jesus, brother."<br><br>Although that greeting didn't suggest a mugger on the prowl, Deucalion turned toward the voice with the hope that the stranger would have a knife, a gun. Even in his rage, he needed justification for violence.<br><br>The panhandler brandished nothing more dangerous than a dirty upturned palm and searing halitosis. "One dollar's all I need."<br><br>"You can't get anything for a dollar," Deucalion said.<br><br>"Bless you if you're generous, but a dollar's all I ask."<br><br>Deucalion resisted the urge to seize the extended hand and snap it off at the wrist as though it were a dry stick.<br><br>Instead, he turned away, and did not look back even when the panhandler cursed him.<br><br>As he was passing the kitchen entrance to a restaurant, that door opened. Two Hispanic men in white pants and T-shirts stepped outside, one offering an open pack of cigarettes to the other.<br><br>Deucalion was revealed by the security lamp above the door and by another directly across the alley from the first.<br><br>Both men froze at the sight of him. One half of his face appeared normal, even handsome, but an intricate tattoo decorated the other half.<br><br>The pattern had been designed and applied by a Tibetan monk skillful with needles. Yet it gave Deucalion a fierce and almost demonic aspect.<br><br>This tattoo was in effect a mask meant to distract the eye from consideration of the broken structures under it, damage done by his creator in the distant past.<br><br>Caught in the crosslight, Deucalion was sufficiently revealed for the two men to detect, if not understand, the radical geometry under the tattoo. They regarded him less with fear than with solemn respect, as they might stand witness to a spiritual visitation.<br><br>He traded light for shadow, that alley for another, his rage escalating to fury. <br><br>His huge hands shook, spasmed as if with the need to throttle. He fisted them, jammed them in his coat pockets.<br><br>Even on this summer night, in the cloying bayou air, he wore a long black coat. Neither heat nor bitter cold affected him. Nor pain, nor fear.<br><br>When he quickened his pace, the commodious coat billowed as if it were a cloak. With a hood, he might have passed for Death himself.<br><br>Perhaps murderous compulsion was woven through his very fiber. His flesh was the flesh of numerous criminals, their bodies having been stolen from a prison graveyard immediately following interment.<br><br>Of his two hearts, one came from a mad arsonist who burned churches. The other had belonged to a child molester.<br><br>Even in a God-made man, the heart can be deceitful and wicked. The heart sometimes rebels against everything that the mind knows and believes. <br><br>If the hands of a priest can do sinful work, then what can be expected of the hands of a convicted strangler? Deucalion's hands had come from just such a criminal.<br><br>His gray eyes had been plucked from the body of an executed ax murderer. Occasionally, a soft luminous pulse passed through them, as though the unprecedented storm that birthed him had left behind its lightning. <br><br>His brain had once filled the skull of an unknown miscreant. Death had erased all memory of that former life, but perhaps the cerebral circuits remained miswired.<br><br>Now his growing fury took him to seedier streets across the river, in Algiers. These darker byways were rank and busy with illegal enterprise. <br><br>One shabby block accommodated a whorehouse thinly disguised as a massage and acupuncture clinic; a tattoo parlor; a pornographic video shop; and a raucous Cajun bar. Zydeco music boomed.<br><br>In cars parked along the alleyway behind these businesses, pimps socialized while they waited to collect from the girls whom they supplied to the brothel. <br><br>Two slicks in Hawaiian shirts and white silk trousers, gliding on roller skates, peddled cocaine cut with powdered Viagra to the whorehouse clientele. They were having a special on Ecstasy and meth.<br><br>Four Harleys stood in a hog line behind the porno shop. Hardcase bikers seemed to be providing security for the whorehouse or for the bar. Or for the drug dealers. Perhaps for all of them. <br><br>Deucalion passed among them, noticed by some, not by others. For him, a black coat and blacker shadows could be almost as concealing as a cloak of invisibility.<br><br>The mysterious lightning that brought him to life had also conveyed to him an understanding of the quantum structure of the universe, and perhaps something more. Having spent two centuries exploring and gradually applying that knowledge, he could when he wished move through the world with an ease, a grace, a stealth that others found bewildering.<br><br>An argument between a biker and a slender young woman at the back door of the whorehouse drew Deucalion as blood in the water draws a shark.<br><br>Although dressed to arouse, the girl looked fresh-faced and vulnerable. She might have been sixteen.<br><br>"Lemme go, Wayne," she pleaded. "I want out."<br><br>Wayne, the biker, held her by both arms, jamming her against the green door. "Once you're in, there is no out."<br><br>"I'm not but fifteen."<br><br>"Don't worry. You'll age fast."<br><br>Through tears, she said, "I never knew it was gonna be like this."<br><br>"What did you think it would be like, you dumb bitch? Richard Gere and Pretty Woman?"<br><br>"He's ugly and he stinks."<br><br>"Joyce, honey, they're all ugly and they all stink. After number fifty, you won't notice anymore."<br><br>The girl saw Deucalion first, and her widening eyes caused Wayne to turn. <br><br>"Release her," Deucalion advised.<br><br>The biker--massive, with a cruel face--was not impressed. "You walk real fast away from here, Lone Ranger, and you might leave with your cojones."<br><br>Deucalion seized his adversary's right arm and bent it behind his back so suddenly, with such violence, that the shoulder broke with a loud crack. He pitched the big man away from him.<br><br>Briefly airborne, Wayne landed face-first, his scream stifled by a mouthful of blacktop.<br><br>A hard stomp to the nape of the biker's neck would have snapped his spine. Remembering torch-bearing mobs with pitchforks in another century, Deucalion restrained himself.<br><br>He turned toward the whoosh of a swung chain.<br><br>Another motorcycle aficionado, a leering grotesque with a studded eyebrow, studded nose, studded tongue, and bristling red beard, recklessly joined the fray.<br><br>Instead of dodging the chain-link whip, Deucalion stepped toward his assailant. The chain lashed around his left arm. He seized it and pulled Redbeard off balance.<br><br>The biker had a ponytail. It served as a handle. <br><br>Deucalion lifted him, punched him, threw him.<br><br>In possession of the chain, he rounded on a third thug, whipped him across the knees.<br><br>The struck man cried out and fell. Deucalion helped him off the ground by throat, by crotch, and slammed him into the fourth of the four enforcers.<br><br>He rapped their heads against a wall to the bar-band beat, creating much misery and perhaps some remorse.<br><br>Already the customers wandering from porno shop to brothel to bar had fled the alleyway. The dealers on wheels had skated with their wares.<br><br>In rapid succession, the pimpmobiles fired up. No one drove toward Deucalion. They reversed out of the alleyway.<br><br>A chopped-and-stretched Cadillac crashed into a yellow Mercedes.<br><br>Neither driver stopped to provide the other with the name of his insurance agent.<br><br>In a moment, Deucalion and the girl, Joyce, were alone with the disabled bikers, though surely watched from doorways and windows. <br><br>In the bar, the zydeco band jammed without faltering. The thick, damp air seemed to shimmer with the music.<br><br>Deucalion walked the girl to the corner, where the alleyway met the street. He said nothing, but Joyce needed no encouragement to stay at his side.<br><br>Although she went with him, she was clearly afraid. She had good reason to be.<br><br>The action in the alley had not diminished his fury. When he was fully self-possessed, his mind was a centuries-old mansion furnished with rich experience, elegant thought, and philosophical reflection. Now, however, it was a many-chambered charnel house dark with blood and cold with the urge to murder.<br><br>As they passed under a streetlamp, treading on the fluttering shadows cast by moths above, the girl glanced at him. He was aware that she shuddered.<br><br>She seemed as bewildered as she was frightened, as if she had awakened from a bad dream and could not yet distinguish between what might be real and what might be remnants of her nightmare.<br><br>In the gloom between streetlamps, when Deucalion put one hand on her shoulder, when they traded shadows for shadows and fading zydeco for louder jazz, her bewilderment increased, and her fear. "What... what just happened? This is the Quarter."<br><br>"At this hour," he warned, as he walked her across Jackson Square, past the statue of the general, "the Quarter is no safer for you than that alleyway. You have somewhere to go?"<br><br>Hugging herself as if the bayou air had taken an arctic chill, she said, "Home."<br><br>"Here in the city?"<br><br>"No. Up to Baton Rouge." She was close to tears. "Home don't seem boring anymore."<br><br>Envy seasoned Deucalion's ferocious anger, for he had never had a home. He'd had places where he stayed, but none had truly been a home.<br><br>A wild criminal desire to smash the girl raged at the bars of the mental cell in which he strove to keep imprisoned his bestial impulses, to smash her because she could go home in a way that he never could.<br><br>He said, "You've got a phone?"<br><br>She nodded, and unclipped a cell phone from her braided belt.<br><br>"You tell your mother and father you'll be waiting in the cathedral over there," he said. <br><br>He walked her to the church, paused in the street, encouraged her forward, made certain to be gone before she turned to look at him.<br>Chapter 2<br>In his mansion in the Garden District, Victor Helios, formerly Frankenstein, began this fine summer morning by making love to his new wife, Erika.<br><br>His first wife, Elizabeth, had been murdered two hundred years ago in the Austrian mountains, on their wedding day. He rarely thought of her anymore.<br><br>He had always been oriented toward the future. The past bored him.

Now he and his lifemate, the brave and beautiful Acorna, can finish rebuilding their once-decimated homeworld. Yet Aari's travels through time have left him oddly changed, and he barely remembers Acorna or their love. And as Aari's actions turn more sinister, Acorna must shift her attention to stopping the destruction of innocents by a vicious criminal. It is precisely the sort of weakness and confusion the dreaded Khleevi have been hoping for, as the brutal insectile oppressors set in motion their final invasion and the total destruction of the Linyaari and the conquest of their world. Though Acorna's heart is wounded, her courage and determination must remain strong in this dark time -- for only then will she be able to rescue the Aari she knows and adores, and halt the bloodthirsty alien menace for good and for all.</p></p><p><p>Anne McCaffrey, a multiple Hugo and Nebula Award winner, was one of the world's most beloved and bestselling science fiction and fantasy writers. She is known for her hugely successful Dragonriders of Pern books, as well as the fantasy series that she cowrote with Elizabeth A. Scarborough that began with <em>Acorna: The Unicorn Girl</em>.</p><br><br><p>Elizabeth Ann Scarborough is the author of <em>Channeling Cleopatra</em> and the Nebula Award-winning <em>The Healer's War</em>, as well as more than twenty science fiction and fantasy novels. She lives in the Puget Sound area of Washington State.</p>More episodic than its predecessors, McCaffrey and Scarborough's finale to the charming Acorna saga will please the two authors' many fans and lovers of horses and cats generally. Last seen in Acorna's Rebels (2003), the unicorn girl has finally located her missing life-mate, Aari, though his exile in time has resulted in a disturbing personality change. Besides helping Aari to recover, Acorna must retrieve a hoard of jewels-chrysoberyls used in terraforming, stolen by a troupe of dancing girls with anti-gravity belts-from three races of sulfur-based beings, the Liquids, Solids and Mutables. She must also contend with the return of the Khleevi, disgusting insectoid aliens with evil designs on Acorna's home planet. And of course there is Grimalkin, the felinoid shape-changer, whose antics delay the well-deserved happy ending after all the bopping back and forth through time, across space and in flight from the Khleevi. While this light SF/fantasy romp is a hopeless proposition for newcomers to Acorna's travels, it serves as a fitting coda to the series. Both Acorna and Aari and their creators can ride off into the starlight with clear consciences. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A well&#x2013;received feature is the grouping by codex to emphasize the great importance of manuscript context in interpreting the poems. The full contents of the Exeter Book are represented, summarized where not translated, to facilitate appreciation of a complete Anglo-Saxon book. The introduction discusses the nature of the legacy, the poet's role, chronology, and especially of translations attempt a style acceptable to the modern ear yet close enough to aid parallel study of the old English text. A check&#x2013;list of extant Anglo-Saxon poetry enhances the practical usefulness of the volume. The whole thus adds up to a substantial and now widely&#x2013;cited survey of the Anglo&#x2013;Saxon poetic achievement.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Is it true Jen and Angelina are still fighting over you?&#x201d;</p><p>Someone kicked Ray&#x2019;s shin. Someone else pushed him. Ray kept snapping pictures of Ira.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is the after-party, Ira? What lucky girl is getting the first dance?&#x201d;</p><p>Ira Edelstein frowned and shielded his face from the camera lens. Ray surged forward undaunted, snapping pictures from every angle. &#x201c;Get out of the way!&#x201d; someone shouted. Someone else pushed him. Ray tried to steady himself.</p><p><i>Snap, snap, snap.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Damn paparazzi!&#x201d; Ira shouted. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t I have a moment of peace?&#x201d;</p><p>Ray rolled his eyes. He did not back off. From behind his camera lens, the vision with the blood returned. He tried to shake it off, but it would not go. Ray kept his finger pressed down on the shutter. Ira the Bar Mitzvah Boy moved in a slow-motion strobe now.</p><p>&#x201c;Parasites!&#x201d; Ira screamed.</p><p>Ray wondered if it was possible to sink any lower.</p><p>Another kick to the shins gave Ray his answer: Nope.</p><p>Ira&#x2019;s &#x201c;bodyguard&#x201d;&#x2014;an enormous guy with a shaved head named Fester&#x2014;swept Ray aside with a forearm the size of an oak. The sweep was with a bit too much gusto, nearly knocking him off his feet. Ray gave Fester a &#x201c;what gives&#x201d; look. Fester mouthed an apology.</p><p>Fester was Ray&#x2019;s boss and friend and the owner of Celeb Experience: Paparazzi for Hire&#x2014;which was just what it sounded like. Ray didn&#x2019;t stalk celebrities hoping to get compromising shots to sell to tabloids like a real paparazzo. No, Ray was actually beneath that&#x2014;Beatlemania to the Beatles&#x2014;offering the &#x201c;celebrity experience&#x201d; to wannabes who were willing to pay. In short, clients, most with extreme self-esteem and probably erectile dysfunction issues, hired paparazzi to follow them around, snapping pictures to give them, per the brochure, the &#x201c;ultimate celebrity experience with your very own exclusive paparazzi.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray could sink lower, he supposed, but not without an extreme act of God.</p><p>The Edelsteins had purchased the A-List MegaPackage&#x2014;two hours with three paparazzi, one bodyguard, one publicist, one boom-mike handler, all following around the &#x201c;celebrity&#x201d; and snapping pictures of him as though he were Charlie Sheen sneaking into a monastery. The A-List MegaPackage also came with a souvenir DVD for no extra charge, plus your face on one of those cheesy-fake gossip magazine covers with a custom-made headline.</p><p>The cost for the A-List MegaPackage?</p><p>Four grand.</p><p>To answer the obvious question: Yes, Ray hated himself.</p><p>Ira pushed past and disappeared into the ballroom. Ray lowered his camera and looked at his two fellow paparazzi. Neither one of them had the loser <i>L</i> tattooed on their forehead because, really, it would have been redundant.</p><p>Ray checked his watch. &#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We still have fifteen minutes on the clock.&#x201d;</p><p>His colleagues&#x2014;both barely bright enough to write their names in the dirt with a finger&#x2014;groaned. Fifteen more minutes. That meant going inside and working the introduction. Ray hated that.</p><p>The bar mitzvah was being held at the Wingfield Manor, a ridiculously gauche banquet hall that, if scaled back a tad, could have doubled as one of Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s palaces. There were chandeliers and mirrors and faux ivory and ornate woodwork and lots and lots of shimmering gold paint.</p><p>The image of the blood came back to him. He blinked it away.</p><p>The event was black-tie. The men looked worn and rich. The women looked well kept and surgically enhanced. Ray pushed through the crowds, wearing jeans, a wrinkled gray blazer, and black Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops. Several guests stared at him as though he&#x2019;d just defecated on their salad fork.</p><p>There was an eighteen-piece band plus a &#x201c;facilitator&#x201d; who was supposed to encourage guest frolicking of all sorts. Think bad TV-game-show host. Think Muppets&#x2019; Guy Smiley. The facilitator grabbed the microphone and said, &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; in a voice reminiscent of a boxing ring announcer, &#x201c;please welcome, for the first time since receiving the Torah and becoming a man, give it up for the one, the only... Ira Edelstein!&#x201d;</p><p>Ira appeared with two... Ray wasn&#x2019;t sure what the right terminology was but perhaps the best phrase would be &#x201c;upscale strippers.&#x201d; The two hot chicks escorted little Ira into the room by the cleavage. Ray got the camera ready and pushed forward, shaking his head. The kid was thirteen. If women who looked like that were ever that close to him when he was thirteen, he&#x2019;d have an erection for a week.</p><p>Ah youth.</p><p>The applause was rapturous. Ira gave the crowd a royal wave.</p><p>&#x201c;Ira!&#x201d; Ray called out. &#x201c;Are these your new goddesses? Is it true you may be adding a third to your harem?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Ira said with a practiced whine, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m entitled to my privacy!&#x201d;</p><p>Ray managed not to vomit. &#x201c;But your public wants to know.&#x201d;</p><p>Fester the Sunglassed Bodyguard put a large mitt on Ray, allowing Ira to brush past him. Ray snapped, making sure the flash worked its magic. The band exploded&#x2014;when did weddings and bar mitzvahs start playing music at a rock-stadium decibel?&#x2014;into the new celebration anthem &#x201c;Club Can&#x2019;t Handle Me.&#x201d; Ira dirty-danced with the two hired helpers. Then his thirteen-year-old friends joined in, crowding the dance floor, jumping straight up and down like pogo sticks. Ray &#x201c;fought&#x201d; through Fester, snapped some more pictures, checked his watch.</p><p>One more minute on the clock.</p><p>&#x201c;Paparazzi scum!&#x201d;</p><p>Another kick to the shins from some little cretin.</p><p>&#x201c;Ow, damn it, that hurt!&#x201d;</p><p>The cretin scurried away. Note to self, Ray thought: Start wearing shin guards. He looked over at Fester as though begging for mercy. Fester let him off the hook with a head gesture to follow him toward the corner. The corner was too loud so they slipped through the doors.</p><p>Fester pointed back into the ballroom with his enormous thumb. &#x201c;Kid did a great job on his haftorah portion, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;</p><p>Ray just stared at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I got a job for you tomorrow,&#x201d; Fester said.</p><p>&#x201c;Groovy. What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Fester looked off.</p><p>Ray didn&#x2019;t like that. &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s George Queller.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dear God.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. And he wants the usual.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray sighed. George Queller tried to impress first dates by overwhelming and ultimately terrifying them. He would hire Celeb Experience to swarm him and his date&#x2014;for example, last month it was a woman named Nancy&#x2014;as they entered a small romantic bistro. Once the date was safely inside, she would be presented with&#x2014;no, this was for real&#x2014;a custom-made menu that would read, &#x201c;George and Nancy&#x2019;s First Date of Many, Many&#x201d; with the address, month, day, and year printed beneath. When they left the restaurant, the paparazzi for hire would be there, snapping away and shouting at how George had turned down a weekend in Turks and Caicos with Jessica Alba for the lovely and now-terror-stricken Nancy.</p><p>George considered these romantic maneuvers a prelude to happy-ever-after. Nancy and her ilk considered these romantic maneuvers a prelude to a ball gag and secluded storage unit.</p><p>There had never been a second date for George.</p><p>Fester finally took off his sunglasses. &#x201c;I want you to work lead on the job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lead paparazzo,&#x201d; Ray said. &#x201c;I better call my mother, so she can brag to her mahjong group.&#x201d;</p><p>Fester chuckled. &#x201c;I love you, you know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we done here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray packed away his camera carefully, separating the lens from the body, and threw the case over his shoulder. He limped toward the door, not from the kicks but the hunk of shrapnel in his hip&#x2014;the shrapnel that started his downward slide. No, that was too simple. The shrapnel was an excuse. At one time in his miserable life, Ray had fairly limitless potential. He&#x2019;d graduated from Columbia University&#x2019;s School of Journalism with what one professor called &#x201c;almost supernatural talent&#x201d;&#x2014;now being wasted&#x2014;in the area of photojournalism. But in the end, that life didn&#x2019;t work out for him. Some people are drawn to trouble. Some people, no matter how easy the path they are given on the walk of life, will find a way to mess it all up.</p><p>Ray Levine was one of those people.</p><p>It was dark out. Ray debated whether he should just head home and go to bed or hit a bar so seedy it was called Tetanus. Tough call when you have so many options.</p><p>He thought about the dead body again.</p><p>The visions came fast and furious now. That was understandable, he supposed. Today was the anniversary of the day it all ended, when any hope of happy-ever-after died like... Well, the obvious metaphor here would involve the visions in his head, wouldn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>He frowned. Hey, Ray, melodramatic much?</p><p>He had hoped that today&#x2019;s inane job would take his mind off it. It hadn&#x2019;t. He remembered his own bar mitzvah, the moment on the pulpit when his father bent down and whispered in his ear. He remembered how his father had smelled of Old Spice, how his father&#x2019;s hand cupped Ray&#x2019;s head so gently, how his father with tears in his eyes simply said, &#x201c;I love you so much.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray pushed the thought away. Less painful to think about the dead body.</p><p>The valets had wanted to charge him&#x2014;no professional courtesy, he guessed&#x2014;so Ray had found a spot three blocks down on a side street. He made the turn, and there it was&#x2014;his piece-o-crap, twelve-year-old Honda Civic with a missing bumper and duct tape holding together a side window. Ray rubbed his chin. Unshaven. Unshaven, forty years old, piece-o-crap car, a basement apartment that if heavily renovated might qualify as a crap hole, no prospects, drank too much. He would feel sorry for himself, but that would involve, well, caring.</p><p>Ray was just taking out his car key when the heavy blow landed on the back of his head.</p><p>What the...?</p><p>He dropped to one knee. The world went dark. The tingle ran up his scalp. Ray felt disoriented. He tried to shake his head, tried to clear it.</p><p>Another blow landed near his temple.</p><p>Something inside his head exploded in a flash of bright light. Ray collapsed to the ground, his body splayed out. He may have lost consciousness&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t sure&#x2014;but suddenly he felt a pulling in his right shoulder. For a moment he just lay limp, not able or wanting to resist. His head reeled in agony. The primitive part of his brain, the base animal section, had gone into survivor mode. Escape more punishment, it said. Crawl into a ball and cover up.</p><p>Another hard tug nearly tore his shoulder out. The tug lessened and began to slip away, and with it, a realization made Ray&#x2019;s eyes snap open.</p><p>Someone was stealing his camera.</p><p>The camera was a classic Leica with a recently updated digital-send feature. He felt his arm lift in the air, the strap running up it. In a second, no more, the camera would be gone.</p><p>Ray didn&#x2019;t have much. The camera was the only possession he truly cherished. It was his livelihood, sure, but it was also the only link to old Ray, to that life he had known before the blood, and he&#x2019;d be damned if he&#x2019;d give that up without a fight.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>The strap was off his arm now. He wondered whether he&#x2019;d have another opportunity, whether the mugger would go for the fourteen bucks in his wallet and give Ray a chance. Couldn&#x2019;t wait to find out.</p><p>With his head still swimming and his knees wobbling, Ray shouted, &#x201c;No!&#x201d; and tried to launch...</p></p><h2>Michael Jackson&#39;s Great Beers of Belgium</h2><p>One of the best known names in quality beer circles updates the survey of Belgium beers he first published in 1991 and revised in 1994 and (in Belgium) in 1997. He revisits some breweries, notes some for the first time, and includes beers that have come on the market since. He also describes the distinctive qualities of the type. Beautiful color photographs accompany his account, of course. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Belgium must be Michael Jackson's idea of heaven. The diversity, individuality, and ubiquity of beer in that country astounds even the beer sophisticate. Belgians lay claim to dozens of brewing styles that, motley as they are, read like a royal registry of beer: Lambics, Abbey Ales, Belgian Whites, Strong Golden Ales, Trappist Ales, Belgian Browns. Consider the Lambic brewer's "wind through the rafters" approach, in which wild yeast and airborne bacteria are responsible for the fermentation process and the otherworldly flavor characteristics of the final product. The brewing style is so dependent on the microflora of the greater Brussels area that it cannot be successfully duplicated anywhere else in the world.<p> Jackson exposes the history and inner workings of this quiet, quirky brewing behemoth with characteristic thoroughness and enthusiasm. We learn the origins of monastic brewing, the good fortune of spiders in Lambic breweries, and the reasoning behind using orange peels, coriander seeds, and three years' worth of stale hops in the brewing process. Ample tasting notes of commercial Belgian products--from those famous worldwide to those available only locally--provide a reference point for the reader's own beer hunting.</p><p> A few bottles of Belgian brew and a copy of <i>Great Beers of Belgium</i> are as close to a brewing tour of Belgium one can get, short of visiting the country itself. Such armchair exploration, with Jackson as a guide, may be just the revelation that makes a physical trip irresistible. <i>--Todd Gehman</i></p>Michael Jackson is the frequently awarded writer of books on beer, whiskey and travels. Maker of the world-famous television series &#39;The Beer Hunter&#39;, he received the 2000 Travel Award of the British Guild of Beer Writers. As a top author and the biggest beer expert on Earth, he has tasted beer and visited breweries from Alaska to Patagonia. In 1999, he was awarded a Glenfiddich Award as Drinks Journalist of the Year for his articles in &#39;The Independent&#39;, &#39;High Life&#39; and the cocktail magazine &#39;Class&#39;.</p><h2>Ignition City Volume 1</h2><p>Where did the space heroes go to die? From Warren Ellis, the writer who reinvented science fiction in comics, in the alternate-world style of the award-winning Ministry Of Space and Aetheric Mechanics, comes a retropunk &#34;future of the past&#34; where spaceships still belched smoke and arguments were still settled with laser pistols. Grounded space pilot Mary Raven has come to the interzone settlement in the middle of Ignition City, Earth&#39;s last spaceport, to recover the effects of her dead fatherso people think. Mary really wants to know how he died, and who did it. Mary Raven is out to spoil a great many people&#39;s days. Today might be her last day on Earth, trapped on the last spaceport where no-one cares about murder and the only real currency is fear. She has her dead father&#39;s raygun, and that&#39;s enough for space hero turned arms dealer Lightning Bowman to want her dead. But she also has her dead father&#39;s diary. And when she finds out something no-one else in the settlement knows... they&#39;ll want her dead for that, too! Featuring the art of Aetheric Mechanics&#39; Gianluca Pagliarani, this full-color volume collects all five issues of the sci-fi epic with a gorgeous cover gallery full of design sketches, ray-gun fights and giant metal machines!</p><p>Warren Ellis is the award-winning British author of comic books, novels, and television, most often recognized for his sociocultural commentary and ground-breaking work in the genre of science fiction. His most recognizable works include Transmetropolitan, Planetary, and The Authority. He maintains a consistent online presence which includes the weekly delivery of the FREAKANGELS web comic to millions of fans. Ellis has published over 25 different creator-owned projects through Avatar Press (including BLACK SUMMER, IGNITION CITY, and GRAVEL, the last of which is in development as a film through Legendary Pictures), with many more planned.</p><h2>David Mitchell: Back Story</h2><p>David Mitchell, who you may know for his inappropriate anger on every TV panel show except Never Mind the Buzzcocks, his look of permanent discomfort on C4 sex comedy Peep Show, his online commenter-baiting in The Observer or just for wearing a stick-on moustache in That Mitchell and Webb Look, has written a book about his life. As well as giving a specific account of every single time he&#39;s scored some smack, this disgusting memoir also details: * the singular, pitbull-infested charm of the FRP (&#39;Flat Roofed Pub&#39;) * the curious French habit of injecting everyone in the arse rather than the arm * why, by the time he got to Cambridge, he really, really needed a drink * the pain of being denied a childhood birthday party at McDonalds * the satisfaction of writing jokes about suicide * how doing quite a lot of walking around London helps with his sciatica * trying to pretend he isn&#39;t a total **** at Robert Webb&#39;s wedding * that he has fallen in love at LOT, but rarely done anything about it * why it would be worse to bump into Michael Palin than Hitler on holiday * that he&#39;s not David Mitchell the novelist. Despite what David Miliband might think</p><p>David Mitchell is a comedian, actor and writer. He stars in Peep Show, writes for the Observer, co-hosts 10 O&#39;Clock Live, has appeared in every TV or radio panel show except Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Quote Unquote and A League Of Their Own and has been in two films neither of which made a profit.

This led to the last and least-known of all Edison&#x2019;s inventions, the spirit phone. His former associate, now bitter rival, Nikola Tesla, was also developing at the same time a similar mysterious device. <b><i>Edison vs. Tesla</i></b> examines their quest to talk to the dead. It reveals:<br><br>Edison&#x2019;s little-known near-death experience formed his theory that animate life forms don&#x2019;t die, but rather change the nature of their composition. It is this foundational belief that drove him to proceed with the spirit phone.<br>Tesla monitored Edison&#x2019;s paranormal work, with both men racing to create a device that picked up the frequencies of discarnate spirits, what today is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).<br>Both men were way ahead of their time, delving into artificial intelligence and robotics.<br>Although mystery and lore surround the details of the last decade of Edison&#x2019;s life, many skeptics have denied the existence of the mysterious spirit phone. The authors have researched both Edison&#x2019;s and Tesla&#x2019;s journals, as well as contemporary articles and interviews with the inventors to confirm that tests were actually done with this device. They also have the full cooperation of the Charles Edison fund, affording them access to rare photos and graphics to support their text. <b><i>Edison vs. Tesla</i></b> sheds light on this weird invention and demonstrates the rivalry that drove both men to new discoveries.</p><p><b>Joel Martin</b> is one of this country's most celebrated authors in the paranormal field.

Working first as a freelancer, then as a staff photographer for the Pittsburgh Courier, one of the preeminent black news weeklies in America, Harris ceaselessly chronicled half a century of African-American life. His work, collected for the first time in this book, offers a rare look into the African-American community during and after the Civil Rights movement.<br>Although he was given the nickname "One Shot" by Mayor David L. Lawrence because of his habit of snapping only one shot when other photographers shot many, Harris's archive is breathtaking in scope, containing more than 80,000 images. Among the most life-affirming photographs are those depicting children, couples, and families. There are also proud images of people at work: a coal miner, an auto mechanic, a barber, a cobbler. American presidents are in the collection, as are Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali. Jazz greats inlude Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, and Louis Armstrong. Although many of Harris's photographs reveal rich lives led with pride, some capture lives in grim circumstances, filled with poverty, crime, violence, and death.<br>Accompanying the illustrations is an essay by cultural critic Stanley Crouch, who weaves together such wide-ranging and disparate topics as American history, baseball, jazz, the growth of the street industry, and African-American culture. Always brilliant and ever surprising, Crouch helps us understand this invaluable collection of work. Historian Deborah Willis provides a biographical outline of the rediscovered artist, now poised on the threshold of prominence in modern American photography. This book offers an important visual history of places and people we have seldom seen, illustrating and revealing the breadth of black urban experience in mid-twentieth century America.</p><p>Stanley Crouch is an editorial columnist for the New York Daily News and a frequent panelist on television and radio talk shows. He is the author of three collections of essays: Always in Pursuit, The All-American Skin Game, Or, the Decoy of Race (nominated for a Nation Book Critics Circle Award), and Notes of a Hanging Judge, and the novel Don&#39;t the Moon Look Lonesome. Deborah Willis is Professor of Photography and Imaging at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. She has curated numerous exhibitions and lectured and published widely on the contributions of African- Americans to contemporary and historical photography.In the mid-20th century Pittsburgh in which he lived and worked, portraitist and Weegee-like street photographer Harris (1908-1998) was known as "One Shot," presumably because he rarely made his subjects, most often African-Americans, sit for retakes. This trove of 135 b&amp;w posed and candid shots, presented by New York Daily News editorial columnist and cultural critic Crouch (The All-American Skin Game), "speak[s] of something so far the other side of alienation that all narrow images of these people-or any people-are called to the carpet." Harris photographed, among other subjects and settings, children cooling under a fire hydrant, integrated couples kissing, women icing cakes in a bakery and Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and other stars when they hit town-and in the process left a 40-year record of everyday life for many blacks in Steel City. The crispness of the images, which allows facial expressions to be read as easily as signs held by men that say "Down with Tokenism," is remarkable, as is the composition: unforced configurations of people that recall the most polished Dutch Master paintings. The images in this book were drawn from a collection of 80,000 by Harris kept under wraps by a legal battle. With their publication, a visual door has been opened onto a once-thriving world. As Crouch writes, "When you have finished with these photographs, you, too, will somehow have become a child of the Steel City, even though that era is now gone."<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lawman (NYT Bestselling Author)</h2><p>When San Antonio FBI agent Garon Grier buys a ranch in Jacobsville, Texas, the strong, silent loner is hoping to mend some broken family fences.

Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<br><br>THE OLD JACOBS PLACE was in disrepair. The last owner hadn't been big on maintenance, and now there was a leak in Garon's study. Right over his damned computer, in fact.<br><br>He glared at it from the doorway, elegantly dressed in a gray suit. He'd just arrived in Jacobsville from Washington, D.C., where he'd been taking a course at Quantico on homicide investigation. It was his new specialty, that area of law enforcement. Garon Grier was a career FBI man. He worked out of the San Antonio office, but he'd recently moved from an apartment there to this huge ranch in Jacobsville. His brother Cash was the Jacobsville police chief. The brothers had been alienated for some time. Cash had disowned his family over his father's remarriage just days after his beloved mother's death from cancer. That long feud had only just ended. Cash was newly, happily, married to Tippy Moore, the "Georgia Fire-fly" of modeling and motion picture fame. She had just had their first child, a little girl.<br><br>Cash thought the child was the crown jewels. To Garon, she looked more like a little red prune with flailing fists. But as the days passed, she did seem to grow prettier. Garon loved children. No one would ever have guessed it. He had a demeanor that was blunt and confrontational. He rarely smiled, and he was usually all business, even with women. Especially with women. He'd lost his one true love to cancer. It had eaten the heart out of him. Now, at thirty-six, he was resigned to being alone for the rest of his life. It was just as well, he decided, because he had nothing to give to a woman. He lived for his job. He would have liked a child of his own, though. A little boy would be nice. But he had no desire to risk his heart in pursuit of one.<br><br>Miss Jane Turner, the housekeeper he'd hired, came into the room behind him, her thin face resigned. "There aren't any construction people available until next week, Mr. Garon," she said in her Texas drawl. "We'd best put a bucket under it for now, I reckon, unless you want to climb up on the roof with a hammer and nails."<br><br>He gave her a superior look. "I don't climb up on roofs," he said flatly.<br><br>She looked him over in the suit."That doesn't surprise me," she muttered, turning to go.<br><br>He gave her a shocked look.She must think he never wore anything but suits, when he'd grown up on a sprawling west Texas ranch. He could ride anything with four legs, and he'd won prizes in rodeo competitions in his teens. Now, he knew more about guns and investigation than he did about rodeo,but he could still run a ranch. In fact, he was stocking purebred black Angus cattle here,and he planned to give his father and brothers a run for their money in cattle shows. He had in mind founding his own champion herd sires here. If he could lick the problem of getting qualified cowboys to work for an outsider, that was. Small towns seemed to draw into themselves when people from other places moved in. Jacobsville had less than two thousand people living in it, and most of them seemed to watch Garon from behind curtained windows every time he walked around town. He was surveyed, measured up and kept carefully at a distance for the time being. People in Jacobsville were particular about letting strangers join the family, because that was what they considered themselves&#x2014;a family of two thousand souls.<br><br>He glanced at his watch. He was already late for a meeting with his squad of agents at the San Antonio FBI office, but last night his flight had been unexpectedly delayed in D.C. by a security hitch. It was early morning before the plane landed in San Antonio. He'd had to drive down to Jacobsville, and he'd barely slept. He walked out onto the wide, concrete front porch with its gray floor and white porch swing and white wicker furniture and cushions. Those were new. It was late February, and his housekeeper said they needed someplace for his company to sit when it came. He told her he wasn't expecting to have any. She snorted and ordered the furniture anyway. She was an authority on everybody who lived around here. She'd probably become an authority on him in short time, but he'd told her graphically what would happen if she dared to pass on any personal gossip about his life. She'd just smiled. He hated that damned smile. If he could have gotten any other spinster lady with her cooking skills to work for him...<br><br>He glanced at an old, black car of unknown vintage coughing smoke as it went slowly down the road. That would be the next-door neighbor, whose little green-trimmed white clapboard house was barely visible through the pecan and mesquite trees that separated his big property from her small one. Her name was Grace Carver. She took care of her elderly grandmother, who had a serious heart condition. The granddaughter wasn't much to look at. She wore her blond hair in a long pigtail, and went around mostly in loose jeans and a sweatshirt. She was shy around Garon. In fact, she seemed to be afraid of him, which was curious. Maybe his reputation had gotten around.<br><br>He'd met her when her old German shepherd dog trespassed into his yard. He'd escaped his fenced pen and she came looking for him, apologizing profusely the whole time. She had green eyes, very pale, and an oval face. She was plain, except for her pretty mouth and exquisite complexion. She'd only stayed long enough to make her apologies and introduce herself. She hadn't come close enough to shake hands, and she'd left as soon as she could, almost dragging the delinquent dog behind her. She hadn't been back since. Miss Jane had mentioned a week or so later that the old dog had died. Old Mrs. Collier, Grace's grandmother, didn't like dogs anyway. Garon remarked that Miss Carver had been nervous around him. Miss Turner told him that Grace was "peculiar" about men. God knew what that meant.<br><br>Miss Jane also said that Grace didn't get out much. She didn't elaborate. He didn't ask anything else about her. He wasn't interested. He liked an occasional night out with an attractive woman, preferably a modern, educated one. Miss Carver was the sort of woman he'd never found interesting.<br><br>He checked his watch, closed the front door and climbed into his black Bucar for the drive to San Antonio. He was entitled to use a Bucar&#x2014;the FBI's term for a bureau conveyance&#x2014;even though a new black Jaguar sat in the garage next to his big Ford Expedition. He carried all his gear and accessories in the Bucar. So he drove it to work. It was going to be something of a commute, but no more than twenty minutes either way. Besides, he was tired of apartment living. Miss Turner was astringent, but she was a hell of a good cook, and she kept house without talking his ear off. He considered himself fortunate.<br><br>He set off down the driveway, casting a curious glance after Grace's choking engine. He wondered if she knew that her car had a mechanical problem, and reasoned that she probably didn't. He glimpsed her from time to time mulching and pruning her roses. She had several bushes of them. That was one thing they did have in common. He loved roses, and during his brief marriage, he'd grown several varieties. It was a hobby he enjoyed,and he had plenty of room to practice it again here at the ranch. Of course, it was February. Not many roses would bloom this time of year.<br><br>THE OFFICE WAS BUZZING when he got there. A local homicide detective with San Antonio P.D. was waiting for him, in his office.<br><br>"I haven't even had time to brief the SAC about the workshop, yet," Garon muttered to the secretary he shared with another agent. "What's he want?" he added, nodding toward the tall, dark-headed man standing at the window with his hands in his pockets and his black hair in a long ponytail, even longer than the one Garon's brother Cash, wore. It designated a renegade.<br><br>"Something about an abducted child case he's working on."<br><br>"I don't do missing person cases unless they end as homicides," he reminded her.<br><br>She gave him a knowing look. "I work here," she pointed out. "I know what you do."<br><br>He glared at her. "Don't get smart." <br><br>"Don't get snippy," she shot back."I could be making twenty dollars an hour as a plumber."<br><br>"Joceline, you can't even put a washer in a faucet," he replied patiently. "Or don't you remember what happened when you tried to fix the leaky one in the women's restroom?"<br><br>She pushed back her short, dark hair. "The floor needed mopping anyway," she told him haughtily. "Now, if you want to know what Detective Marquez wants, why don't you go and ask him?"<br><br>He sighed irritably."Okay. How about a cup of coffee?"<br><br>"Already had one, thanks," she said. She gave him a smile.<br><br>"I hate liberated women," he grumbled.<br><br>"Gee, can't you lift a coffee cup all by yourself?" she asked with mock surprise. <br><br>"When you come asking for a raise, see what happens," he said.<br><br>"When you want a case report typed, see what happens," was the smug reply.<br><br>He muttered in gutter Spanish all the way into his office. He hoped Joceline understood every single nasty word. But if she did, she didn't let on.<br><br>The detective heard his footsteps and turned. He had black eyes and an olive complexion, and a worried expression.<br><br>"I'm Marquez," he introduced himself, shaking hands. "You'd be Special Agent Grier, I assume?"<br><br>"If I'm not, I don't have to look at all that paperwork piled on my desk," Garon replied dryly."Have a seat. Like a cup of coffee?" he added, then grimaced. "We'll have to go get it ourselves, of course, because my secretary is a liberated woman!" he raised his voice as she went past the door.<br><br>"The computer is about to eat your six-page letter to the attorney general about your proposed new legislation," she called merrily. "Sorry, but I'm sure you can draft a new one..."<br><br>"If you ever get married, I'll give you away!"<br><br>"If I ever get married, I'll give you away," she retorted and kept walking.<br><br>He sat down behind his desk with a rough sound in his throat. "She and my housekeeper must be sisters," he told the visitor. "I hired them and they tell mewhat to do."<br><br>Marquez only smiled. "I was told that you head a squad that deals with violent crimes against children," he said.<br><br>Garon leaned back in his chair, and all the humor went out of his face. "Technically I head a squad that deals with violent crime, up to and including serial murder. I've never worked child murders."<br><br>Marquez frowned. "Then who does?" <br><br>"Special Agent Trent Jones was our crimes against children specialist," he replied."But he just got transferred back to Quantico to work on a high profile case. We haven't had time to replace him." He frowned. "I thought Joceline said you had a missing person case?"<br><br>Marquez nodded. He looked as solemn as Garon did. "It started out as a missing person case. Now it's a homicide; a ten-year-old girl," he said quietly. "We've checked out everyone close to her, including both parents, and we can't turn a perpetrator. Now we think it might have been a stranger."<br><br>This was serious business. The news had been full of abducted children who were murdered by convicted sex offenders, all over the country. The case was, sadly, not that unique.<br><br>"Do you have any leads?"<br><br>Marquez shook his head. "We only found the body yesterday. That's why I'm here. I found a similar case. I think it's a serial crime. That means I can ask you for help."<br><br>Garon leaned back in his chair. "When was she abducted?"<br><br>"Three days ago," Marquez said quietly.<br><br>"Any latents at the scene?" Garon asked.<br><br>"No, and we had the criminologists on their hands and knees all over her bedroom with blue lights. Nothing. Not a single latent fingerprint."<br><br>"He took her out of her bedroom?" he asked, surprised.<br><br>"In the middle of the night, and nobody heard anything," Marquez replied.<br><br>"Footprints, tire tracks...?"<br><br>Marquez shook his head. "Either this guy is very lucky, or..."<br><br>"...or he's done this before," Garon finished for him.<br><br>Marquez drew in a long breath. "Exactly. Of course, my lieutenant doesn't buy that. He thinks we've got a pedophile who carried the kid away and killed her.I told him that this is the second case of bedroom abduction we've seen in the past two years. The last one was over in Palo Verde,and the child was murdered in a similar manner. I found it listed on VICAP, the FBI's violent criminal apprehension program. I showed it to the lieutenant. He told me I was chasing ghosts."<br><br></p><h2>The Possibility of an Island</h2><p>A worldwide phenomenon and the most famous French novelist since Camus, Michel Houellebecq now delivers his magnum opus&#x2014;a tale of our present circumstances told from the future, when humanity as we know it has vanished.<br><br>Having made a fortune producing comedies that skewer mankind&#x2019;s consumerism, religious fundamentalism, sexual profligacy, and other affronts, Daniel is forty before he falls prey to the human condition himself: his beloved&#x2019;s body sags with age, their marriage dissolves, and true happiness seems a luxury reserved for their dog, Fox. After the colossal failure of his second great love affair, he joins a cult of health fanatics determined to produce a misery-free eternal life&#x2014;manifested here in the voices of Daniel&#x2019;s subsequent clones, who enjoy the umpteenth Fox&#x2019;s companionship but shun the bands of fugitive &#x201c;humans&#x201d; on the horizon. Their commentary on Daniel&#x2019;s fate, and on the race as a whole, illuminates the basic tenets of our existence&#x2014;laughter, tears, love, remorse&#x2014;and their nostalgia for such emotions, all of which have long since disappeared.<br><br>Laugh-out-loud funny, philosophically compelling, and flatly heartbreaking, <i>The Possibility of an Island </i>is at once an indictment, an elegy, and a celebration of everything we have and are at risk of losing.</p><p>Michel Houellebecq has won the prestigious Prix Novembre in France and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. He lives in Ireland.Daniel 1, 1 <br><br><i>Now, what does a rat do when it's awake? It sniffs about.</i>&#x2014;Jean-Didier, biologist<br><br>How vividly I remember the first moments of my vocation as a clown! I was seventeen at the time, and spending a rather dreary month in an <i>all-inclusive</i> resort in Turkey&#x2014;it was, incidentally, the last time I was to go on holiday with my parents. My silly bitch of a sister&#x2014;she was thirteen at the time&#x2014;was just beginning to turn the guys on. It was at breakfast; as usual in the morning, a line had formed in front of the scrambled eggs, something the vacationers seemed incredibly fond of. Next to me, an old Englishwoman (desiccated, nasty, the kind who would cut up foxes to decorate her living room), who had already helped herself copiously to eggs, didn't hesitate to snaffle up the last three sausages on the hot plate. It was five to eleven, the breakfast service had come to an end, it was inconceivable that the waiter would bring out any more sausages. The German who was in the line behind her became rigid; his fork, already reaching for a sausage, stopped in midair, and his face turned red with indignation. He was an enormous German, a colossus, more than two meters tall and weighing at least one hundred and fifty kilos. I thought for a moment that he was going to plant his fork in the octogenarian's eyes, or grab her by the neck and smash her head onto the hot plates. She, with that senile, unconscious selfishness of old people, came trotting back to her table as if nothing had happened. The German was angry, I could sense that he was incredibly angry, but little by little his face grew calm, and he went off sadly, sausageless, in the direction of his compatriots.<br><br>Out of this incident I composed a little sketch about a bloody revolt in a holiday resort, sparked by the tiny details that contradicted the <i>all-inclusive</i> formula: a shortage of sausages at breakfast, followed by a supplemental charge for the mini-golf. That evening, I performed this sketch at the "You Have Talent!" soir�e (one evening every week the show was made up of turns done by the vacationers, instead of by professionals); I played all the characters, thus taking my first steps down the road of the one-man show, a road I scarcely left throughout my career. Nearly everyone came to the after-dinner show, as there was fuck-all to do until the discotheque opened; that meant an audience of eight hundred people. My sketch was a resounding success, people cried with laughter, and there was noisy applause. That very evening, at the discotheque, a pretty brunette called Sylvie told me I had made her laugh a lot, and that she liked boys with a sense of humor. Dear Sylvie. And so, in this way, my virginity was lost and my vocation decided.<br><br>After my baccalaureate, I signed up for acting lessons; there followed some inglorious years, during which I grew nastier and nastier and, as a consequence, more and more caustic; thanks to this, success finally arrived&#x2014;on a scale that surprised me. I had begun with small sketches on reunited immigrant families, journalists for <i>Le Monde,</i> and the mediocrity of the middle classes in general&#x2014;I successfully captured the incestuous temptations of midcareer intellectuals aroused by their daughters or daughters-in-law, with their bare belly buttons and thongs showing above their pants. In short, I was a <i>cutting observer of contemporary reality;</i> I was often compared to Pierre Desproges. While continuing to devote myself to the one-man show, I occasionally accepted invitations to appear on television programs, which I chose for their big audiences and general mediocrity. I never forgot to emphasize this mediocrity, albeit subtly: the presenter had to feel a little endangered, but not too much. All in all, I was a good professional; I was just a bit overrated. I was not the only one.<br><br>I don't mean that my sketches were unfunny; they <i>were</i> funny. I was, indeed, a <i>cutting observer of contemporary reality;</i> it was just that everything now seemed so elementary to me, it seemed that so few things remained that could be observed in contemporary reality: we had simplified and pruned so much, broken so many barriers, taboos, misplaced hopes, and false aspirations; truly, there was so little left. On the social level, there were the rich and the poor, with a few fragile links between them&#x2014;the <i>social ladder,</i> a subject on which it was the done thing to joke; and the more serious possibility of being ruined. On the sexual level there were those who aroused desire, and those who did not: a tiny mechanism, with a few complications of modality (homosexuality, etc.) that could nevertheless be easily summarized as vanity and narcissistic competition, which had already been well described by the French moralists three centuries before. There were also, of course, the <i>honest folk,</i> those who work, who ensure the effective production of wealth, also those who make sacrifices for their children&#x2014;in a manner that is rather comic or, if you like, pathetic (but I was, above all, a comedian); those who have neither beauty in their youth, nor ambition later, nor riches ever; but who hold on wholeheartedly, and more sincerely than anyone, to the values of beauty, youth, wealth, ambition, and sex; those who, in some kind of way, <i>make the sauce bind.</i> Those people, I am afraid to say, could not constitute a <i>subject.</i> I did, however, include a few of them in my sketches to give diversity, and the <i>reality effect;</i> but I began all the same to get seriously tired. What's worse is that I was considered to be a <i> humanist;</i> a pretty abrasive humanist, but a humanist all the same. To give some context, here is one of the jokes that peppered my shows:<br><br> "Do you know what they call the fat stuff around the vagina?"<br><br> "No."<br><br> "The woman."<br><br>Strangely, I managed to throw in that kind of thing, while still getting good reviews in <i>Elle</i> and <i>T</i>�<i>l</i>�<i>rama;</i> it's true that the arrival of the Arab immigrant comedians had validated macho excesses once more, and that I was genuinely excessive, albeit with grace: going close to the bone, repeatedly, but always staying in control. Finally, the benefit of the humorist's trade, or more generally of a <i>humorous attitude</i> in life, is to be able to behave like a complete bastard with impunity, and even to profit hugely from your depravity, in terms of sexual conquests and money, all with general approval.<br><br>My supposed humanism was, in reality, built on very thin foundations: a vague outburst against tobacconists, an allusion to the corpses of negro clandestines cast up on the Spanish coasts, had been enough to give me a reputation as a <i>lefty</i> and a <i>defender of human rights.</i> Me, a lefty? I had occasionally been able to introduce a few, vaguely young, antiglobalization campaigners into my sketches, without giving them an immediately antipathetic role; I had occasionally indulged in a certain demagogy: I was, I repeat, a good professional. Besides, I looked like an Arab, which helps; the only residual ideological content of the left, in those days, was antiracism, or more precisely antiwhite racism. I did not in fact know the origins of these Arab features, which became more pronounced as the years went by: my mother was of Spanish origin and my father, as far as I know, was Breton. For example, my sister, that little bitch, was certainly the Mediterranean type, but she wasn't half as dark as me, and her hair was straight. One had to wonder: had my mother always been scrupulously faithful? Or had I been engendered by some Mustapha? Or even&#x2014;another hypothesis&#x2014;by a Jew? Fuck that: Arabs came to my shows in droves&#x2014;Jews also, by the way, although in smaller numbers; and all these people paid for their tickets, at the full price. We all worry about the circumstances of our death; the circumstances of our birth, however, are less worrisome to us.<br><br>As for <i>human rights,</i> quite obviously I couldn't give a toss; I could hardly manage to be interested in the rights of my cock.<br><br>In that particular respect, the rest of my career had more or less confirmed my first success at the holiday club. Women in general lack a sense of humor, which is why they consider humor to be one of the virile qualities; throughout my career, opportunities for placing my organ in one of the appropriate orifices were never lacking. To tell the truth, such intercourse was never up to much: women who are interested in comedians are getting old, nearly forty, and are beginning to suspect that things are going to turn bad. Some of them had fat asses, others breasts like flannels, sometimes both. In other words, there was nothing arousing about them; and, anyway, when it's more and more difficult to get a hard-on, the interest goes. They weren't all that old, either; I knew that as they approached fifty they would once again long for something reassuring, easy, and false&#x2014;and of course they wouldn't find it. In the meantime, I could only confirm to them&#x2014;completely unintentionally, believe me, it's never a pleasure&#x2014;the decline of their erotic value; I could only confirm their first suspicions, and instill in them, despite myself, a despairing view of life: no, it was not maturity that awaited them, but simply old age; there was not a new blossoming at the end of the road, but a bundle of frustrations and sufferings, at first insignificant, then very quickly unbearable; it wasn't very healthy, all that, not very healthy at all. Life begins at fifty, that's true; inasmuch as it ends at forty.<br>Daniel 24, 1<br><br>Look at the little creatures moving in the distance; look.

Beagle's novel with art by Renae De Liz! Whimsical. Lyrical. Poignant. Deeply Moving.<i> The Last Unicorn</i> is a tale for any age about the wonders of magic, the power of love, and the tragedy of loss. A unicorn, alone in her enchanted wood, discovers that she may be the last of her kind. Reluctant at first, she sets out on a journey to find her fellow unicorns, even if it means facing the terrifying anger of the Red Bull and malignant evil of the king who wields the Bull's power. </li></ul></p><p><i>The Last Unicorn</i> is one of the true classics of fantasy, ranking with Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit</i>, Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy, and Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. Beagle writes a shimmering prose-poetry, the voice of fairy tales and childhood:<p> </p><blockquote>The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea.</blockquote><p> The unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the others. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he intended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of the mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes in legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead wait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.</p><p> This is a book no fantasy reader should miss; Beagle argues brilliantly the need for magic in our lives and the folly of forgetting to dream. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><b>Peter S.

The whole financial system was collapsing, with little to stop it. When a senator asked Bernanke what would happen if the central bank did not carry out its rescue package, he replied, &#x201c;If we don&#x2019;t do this, we may not have an economy on Monday.&#x201d;</p><p>What saved finance, and the Western economy, was fiscal and monetary stimulus &#x2013; an influx of money, created ad hoc. It was a strategy that raised questions about the unexamined nature of money itself, an object suddenly revealed as something other than a neutral signifier of value. Through its grip on finance and the debt system, money confers sovereign power on the economy. If confidence in money is not maintained, crises follow. Looking over the last 5,000 years, Michel Aglietta explores the development of money and its close connection to sovereign power. This book employs the tools of anthropology, history and political economy in order to analyse how political structures and monetary systems have transformed one another. We can thus grasp the different eras of monetary regulation and the crises capitalism has endured throughout its history.</p></p><p><p><b>Michel Aglietta</b> is Emeritus Professor at the Universit� Paris-Ouest, where he is a scholarly advisor to the CEPII and France Strat�gie.</p><p><b>Pepita Ould Ahmed</b> is an economist at the Institutde recherche pour le d�veloppement (IRD) and member of the CESSMA at the Universit� Paris&#x2013;Diderot.</p><p><b>Jean-Fran�ois Ponsot </b>is a lecturer at the Centre de recherche en �conomie de Grenoble at the Universit� Grenoble-Alpes.</p>&#x201c;Believe it or not, money is absent from the economic theories that underpin <i>every</i> policy ever enacted on our behalf! Michel Aglietta&#x2019;s new book explains splendidly this remarkable absence and, in the process, highlights beautifully the clash between finance and democracy, with special emphasis on how the US dollar&#x2019;s domination reflects, on the one hand, America&#x2019;s geopolitical power and, on the other, the inherent incongruities of the financial sector.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Yanis Varoufakis, author of <i>And the Weak Suffer What They Must?</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A splendid account of the history of money from antiquity through modern times. Aglietta places money, debt, and credit at the heart of an analysis of&#x2014;among many things&#x2014;the Great Financial Crisis and the future of the dollar, the renminbi, and the euro.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;James K. Galbraith, author of <i>The End of Normal</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Money is one of the most misunderstood parts of modern-day capitalism: it is not just a medium of exchange; it is a social relationship. How we structure the financial system and the associated characteristics of debt payments fundamen�tally affects how the real economy operates. Michel Aglietta brings his powerful &#x2018;regulation school&#x2019; framework to understanding money and how we use this understanding to restructure the international monetary system.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Mariana Mazzucato, author of <i>The Value of Everything</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;An impressive attempt to reintegrate macroeconomics into macrosociology and political theory and philosophy, from one of the leading economists of our time.

Fat and cholesterol were as closely monitored as his blood pressure and pulse. Equally concerned about our young son Jordan, who was tested and found to have hereditary high cholesterol, diet and nutrition became my primary focus. After many consultations with hospital dieticians and outside nutritionalists, we were given charts, books, and the clear message, No Red Meat! As a good dietary student frightened by our situation, I diligently followed the dictates of the hospital, making the directives a learning process. We eliminated red meat from our diet and transformed all of the gourmet cooking my family had become accustomed to into healthy and acceptable heart smart cuisine. Challenges always entice me...the bigger the challenges, the more interesting it becomes. We began eating endless quantities of vegetables, fruits, chicken, turkey, and tofu (higher in fat, but still legitimate). Still, we longed for that juicy burger or succulent rare steak. Three years later and tofued into oblivion, David and I were in South Dakota, as David was commissioned to do the painting for Mt. Rushmore&#39;s fiftieth anniversary celebration. Numerous local eateries were serving buffalo burgers and other bison specialities - touting this game as a healthy alternative to beef. The claims were accurate; there was virtually no fat present in the meat. Buffalo/bison became the salvation of our dietary dilemma.</p><p>Ruth M JohnstonBilled as a cookbook for health-conscious meat eaters, Johnston's collection of recipes is underscored by the fact that there is virtually no fat in buffalo meat. Large size and invitingly illustrated, her book offers an amazing array of dishes, some of which are complicated, "not every recipe is . . . designed to be a quick and easy family dinner." Many "utilize numerous and unusual herbs and spices," and preceeding the recipe presentation is an interesting discussion of the American buffalo's natural history and its traditional place and usage in Native American culture.

The governess was always getting muddled with her astrolabe, and when she got specially muddled she would take it out of the Wart by rapping his knuckles. She did not rap Kay&#x2019;s knuckles, because when Kay grew older he would be Sir Kay, the master of the estate. The Wart was called the Wart because it more or less rhymed with Art, which was short for his real name. Kay had given him the nickname. Kay was not called anything but Kay, as he was too dignified to have a nickname and would have flown into a passion if anybody had tried to give him one. The governess had red hair and some mysterious wound from which she derived a lot of prestige by showing it to all the women of the castle, behind closed doors. It was believed to be where she sat down, and to have been caused by sitting on some armour at a picnic by mistake. Eventually she offered to show it to Sir Ector, who was Kay&#x2019;s father, had hysterics and was sent away. They found out afterwards that she had been in a lunatic hospital for three years.</p><p>In the afternoons the programme was: Mondays and Fridays, tilting and horsemanship; Tuesdays, hawking; Wednesdays, fencing; Thursdays, archery; Saturdays, the theory of chivalry, with the proper measures to be blown on all occasions, terminology of the chase and hunting etiquette. If you did the wrong thing at the mort or the undoing, for instance, you were bent over the body of the dead beast and smacked with the flat side of a sword. This was called being bladed. It was horseplay, a sort of joke like being shaved when crossing the line. Kay was not bladed, although he often went wrong.</p><p>When they had got rid of the governess, Sir Ector said, &#x201c;After all, damn it all, we can&#x2019;t have the boys runnin&#x2019; about all day like hooligans&#x2014;after all, damn it all? Ought to be havin&#x2019; a first-rate eddication, at their age. When I was their age I was doin&#x2019; all this Latin and stuff at five o&#x2019;clock every mornin&#x2019;. Happiest time of me life. Pass the port.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Grummore Grummursum, who was staying the night because he had been benighted out questin&#x2019; after a specially long run, said that when he was their age he was swished every mornin&#x2019; because he would go hawkin&#x2019; instead of learnin&#x2019;. He attributed to this weakness the fact that he could never get beyond the Future Simple of Utor. It was a third of the way down the left-hand leaf, he said. He thought it was leaf ninety-seven. He passed the port.</p><p>Sir Ector said, &#x201c;Had a good quest today?&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Grummore said, &#x201c;Oh, not so bad. Rattlin&#x2019; good day, in fact. Found a chap called Sir Bruce Saunce Pit� choppin&#x2019; off a maiden&#x2019;s head in Weedon Bushes, ran him to Mixbury Plantation in the Bicester, where he doubled back, and lost him in Wicken Wood. Must have been a good twenty-five miles as he ran.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A straight-necked &#x2019;un,&#x201d; said Sir Ector.</p><p>&#x201c;But about these boys and all this Latin and that,&#x201d; added the old gentleman. &#x201c;Amo, amas, you know, and runnin&#x2019; about like hooligans: what would you advise?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, laying his finger by his nose and winking at the bottle, &#x201c;that takes a deal of thinkin&#x2019; about, if you don&#x2019;t mind my sayin&#x2019; so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind at all,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;Very kind of you to say anythin&#x2019;. Much obliged, I&#x2019;m sure. Help yourself to port.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good port this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get it from a friend of mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But about these boys,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;How many of them are there, do you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;counting them both, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t send them to Eton, I suppose?&#x201d; inquired Sir Grummore cautiously. &#x201c;Long way and all that, we know.&#x201d;</p><p>It was not really Eton that he mentioned, for the College of Blessed Mary was not founded until 1440, but it was a place of the same sort. Also they were drinking Metheglyn, not port, but by mentioning the modern wine it is easier to give you the feel.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t so much the distance,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;but that giant What&#x2019;s-&#x2019;is-name is in the way. Have to pass through his country, you understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is his name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t recollect it at the moment, not for the life of me. Fellow that lives by the Burbly Water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Galapas,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the very chap.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other thing,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to have a tutor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;A tutor, you know, a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have some more port,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;You need it after all this questin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Splendid day,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;Only they never seem to kill nowadays. Run twenty-five miles and then mark to ground or lose him altogether. The worst is when you start a fresh quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We kill all our giants cubbin&#x2019;,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;After that they give you a fine run, but get away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Run out of scent,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;I dare say. It&#x2019;s always the same with these big giants in a big country. They run out of scent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But even if you was to have a tutor,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how you would get him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Advertise,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;I have advertised,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;It was cried by the <i>Humberland Newsman and Cardoile Advertiser</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other way,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to start a quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a quest for a tutor,&#x201d; explained Sir Ector.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hic, Haec, Hoc,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;Have some more of this drink, whatever it calls itself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hunc,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>So it was decided. When Grummore Grummursum had gone home next day, Sir Ector tied a knot in his handkerchief to remember to start a quest for a tutor as soon as he had time to do so, and, as he was not sure how to set about it, he told the boys what Sir Grummore had suggested and warned them not to be hooligans meanwhile. Then they went hay-making.</p><p>It was July, and every able-bodied man and woman on the estate worked during that month in the field, under Sir Ector&#x2019;s direction. In any case the boys would have been excused from being eddicated just then.</p><p>Sir Ector&#x2019;s castle stood in an enormous clearing in a still more enormous forest. It had a courtyard and a moat with pike in it. The moat was crossed by a fortified stone bridge which ended half-way across it. The other half was covered by a wooden drawbridge which was wound up every night. As soon as you had crossed the drawbridge you were at the top of the village street&#x2014;it had only one street&#x2014;and this extended for about half a mile, with thatched houses of wattle and daub on either side of it. The street divided the clearing into two huge fields, that on the left being cultivated in hundreds of long narrow strips, while that on the right ran down to a river and was used as pasture. Half of the right-hand field was fenced off for hay.</p><p>It was July, and real July weather, such as they had in Old England. Everybody went bright brown, like Red Indians, with startling teeth and flashing eyes. The dogs moved about with their tongues hanging out, or lay panting in bits of shade, while the farm horses sweated through their coats and flicked their tails and tried to kick the horse-flies off their bellies with their great hind hoofs. In the pasture field the cows were on the gad, and could be seen galloping about with their tails in the air, which made Sir Ector angry.</p><p>Sir Ector stood on the top of a rick, whence he could see what everybody was doing, and shouted commands all over the two-hundred-acre field, and grew purple in the face. The best mowers mowed away in a line where the grass was still uncut, their scythes roaring in the strong sunlight. The women raked the dry hay together in long strips with wooden rakes, and the two boys with pitchforks followed up on either side of the strip, turning the hay inwards so that it lay well for picking up. Then the great carts followed, rumbling with their spiked wooden wheels, drawn by horses or slow white oxen. One man stood on top of the cart to receive the hay and direct operations, while one man walked on either side picking up what the boys had prepared and throwing it to him with a fork. The cart was led down the lane between two lines of hay, and was loaded in strict rotation from the front poles to the back, the man on top calling out in a stern voice where he wanted each fork to be pitched. The loaders grumbled at the boys for not having laid the hay properly and threatened to tan them when they caught them, if they got left behind.</p><p>When the wagon was loaded, it was drawn to Sir Ector&#x2019;s rick and pitched to him. It came up easily because it had been loaded systematically&#x2014;not like modern hay&#x2014;and Sir Ector scrambled about on top, getting in the way of his assistants, who did the real work, and stamping and perspiring and scratching about with his fork and trying to make the rick grow straight and shouting that it would all fall down as soon as the west winds came.</p><p>The Wart loved hay-making, and was good at it. Kay, who was two years older, generally stood on the edge of the bundle which he was trying to pick up, with the result that he worked twice as hard as the Wart for only half the result. But he hated to be beaten at anything, and used to fight away with the wretched hay&#x2014;which he loathed like poison&#x2014;until he was quite sick.</p><p>The day after Sir Grummore&#x2019;s visit was sweltering for the men who toiled from milking to milking and then again till sunset in their battle with the sultry element. For the hay was an element to them, like sea or air, in which they bathed and plunged themselves and which they even breathed in. The seeds and small scraps stuck in their hair, their mouths, their nostrils, and worked, tickling, inside their clothes. They did not wear many clothes, and the shadows between their sliding muscles were blue on the nut-brown skins. Those who feared thunder had felt ill that morning.</p><p>In the afternoon the storm broke. Sir Ector kept them at it till the great flashes were right overhead, and then, with the sky as dark as night, the rain came hurling against them so that they were drenched at once and could not see a hundred yards. The boys lay crouched under the wagons, wrapped in hay to keep their wet bodies warm against the now cold wind, and all joked with one another while heaven fell. Kay was shivering, though not with cold, but he joked like the others because he would not show he was afraid. At the last and greatest thunderbolt every man startled involuntarily, and each saw the other startle, until they laughed away their shame.</p><p>But that was the end of the hay-making and the beginning of play. The boys were sent home to change their clothes. The old dame who had been their nurse fetched dry jerkins out of a press, and scolded them for catching their deaths, and denounced Sir Ector for keeping on so long. Then they slipped their heads into the laundered shirts, and ran out to the refreshed and sparkling court.</p><p>&#x201c;I vote we take Cully and see if we can get some rabbits in the chase,&#x201d; cried the Wart.</p><p>&#x201c;The rabbits will not be out in this wet,&#x201d; said Kay sarcastically, delighted to have caught him over natural history.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on. It will soon be dry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I must carry Cully, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Kay insisted on carrying the goshawk and flying her, when they went hawking together. This he had a right to do, not only because he was older than the Wart but also because he was Sir Ector&#x2019;s proper son. The Wart was not a proper son. He did not understand this, but it made him feel unhappy, because Kay seemed to regard it as making him inferior in some way. Also it was different not having a father and mother, and Kay had taught him that being different was wrong. Nobody talked to him about it, but he thought about it when he was alone, and was distressed. He did not like people to bring it up. Since the other boy always did bring it up when a question of precedence arose, he had got into the habit of giving in at once before it could be mentioned. Besides, he admired Kay and was a born follower. He was a hero-worshipper.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; cried the Wart, and they scampered off toward the Mews, turning a few cartwheels on the way.</p></p><h2>The Dracula Tape</h2><p>Count Dracula tells his own version of his fateful journey to England in 1891, presenting a surprising revision to the well-known tale.

Despite her age, she was already a veteran actress, living a charmed life, moving from one Hollywood set to the next. But behind the scenes, her success was fueled by the pride, pressure, and sometimes grinding cruelty of her stage mother, as fame and a mother's ambition pushed her older sister deeper into the shadows. <i>Diary of a Stage Mother's Daughter</i> is a fascinating account of life as a child star in the 1980's, and also a startling tale of a family under the care of a highly neurotic, dangerously competitive "tiger mother." But perhaps most importantly, now that Melissa has two sons of her own, it's a meditation on motherhood, and the value of pushing your children: how hard should you push a child to succeed, and at what point does your help turn into harm?</p><p><p>A graduate of Harvard University, <b>Melissa Francis</b> grew up in southern California.&nbsp;As a broadcast journalist, she has anchored CNBC's <i>Power Lunch</i>, <i>The Call</i>, and <i>On The Money,</i> served as a regular contributor to the <i>Today</i> show and <i>Weekend Today</i> Show, and currently hosts two daily business shows on the Fox Business Network.&nbsp;She lives in New York City with her husband and their two sons.</p><p><b>Hoda Kotb, author of <i>Hoda: How I Survived War Zones, Bad Hair, Cancer, and Kathie Lee</i>, and co-host of the <i>Today </i>show<br></b>&#x201c;I am always in search of the book I can&#x2019;t put down.&nbsp; Well, thanks to Melissa Francis, I FOUND it.&nbsp;I may have missed a few nights sleep, but I am so much better for it. &nbsp;Her book is captivating, revealing and ultimately healing. &nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew the kid from <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> had such a fascinating real-life story?&nbsp; I am in awe.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Kirkus Review<br></b>"Chilling memoir by a Fox Business Network anchor and child star chronicles the misery of growing up with a cruel, controlling and abusive stage mother.

If she didn&#x2019;t get away from them, there would be another bullet, another wound.</p> <p>Or death.</p> <p>She had been lucky to have seen them coming up the road toward the cabin and guessed that they had been sent to kill her. She had slipped out of the cabin, but they had caught sight of her running into the woods. She had heard Mick Judaro shout to Tantona when he saw her. He&#x2019;s been surprised, they&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d be easy game. But she&#x2019;d been waiting for them for the last three days.</p> <p>Waiting for death.</p> <p>No, she wouldn&#x2019;t let them kill her. She could feel the anger tearing through her, smothering the fear.</p> <p>&#x201c;Stop, Teresa. We didn&#x2019;t mean to hurt you. That was only supposed to be a warning shot.&#x201d; It was Hank Tantona calling out to her. &#x201c;We were just sent to bring you back. You know me. I&#x2019;ve watched you grow up. I was at your sixteenth birthday party last month.&#x201d;</p> <p>She had not wanted to have that party, but Mother had insisted. She had said it would look strange if she didn&#x2019;t throw a party for her. And she had been aware of Tantona leaning against the wall while she blew out the candles. Smiling, joking with her father. She hadn&#x2019;t been able to look at him.</p> <p>His memories were too dark, too ugly, swirling around, pushing into every corner of his mind. He didn&#x2019;t try to keep that ugliness tucked away. He was proud of it.</p> <p>Like her father.</p> <p>But she had learned to shut herself away from her father&#x2019;s memories. She wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to survive living with him if she hadn&#x2019;t.</p> <p>She ran faster.</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re scared,&#x201d; Tantona shouted. &#x201c;But Rico Camano doesn&#x2019;t want to hurt you either. He only wants to talk to you. He was a good friend to your father. He wants to find out who murdered him. He thinks you can help.&#x201d;</p> <p>Liar. Liar. Liar.</p> <p>&#x201c;But you have to obey Camano just like you did your father. After all, he&#x2019;s our boss now, Teresa. He&#x2019;s the Don. And your father would like him to be in charge now that he&#x2019;s gone. Camano will treat you well if you just do what he says.&#x201d;</p> <p>Camano would kill her. She had seen it in his face at her father&#x2019;s funeral. He had smiled at her and patted her shoulder, but she could still feel the coldness of him.</p> <p>Then he had smiled at her mother, Gina, and she had smiled back.</p> <p>And Teresa had known that she was alone.</p> <p>&#x201c;But if you don&#x2019;t stop, we may have to take you down, Teresa,&#x201d; Tantona called. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll try not to hurt you again, but I can&#x2019;t promise. Just give up and let us talk to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her breath was coming in gasps, and the pain was getting worse. &#x201c;Blood,&#x201d; she muttered. She had to do something about that blood&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, you do.&#x201d;</p> <p>She paused, startled at the words that had come out of nowhere. Her gaze flew to the path in front of her.</p> <p>A man stood on the path a few yards away. Tall, dark-haired, gleaming, light blue eyes. Dressed in dark jeans and sweatshirt. She didn&#x2019;t recognize him. He was a stranger. But everyone was the enemy.</p> <p>Her hand tightened on the branch in her hand, then she crouched and swung the branch at him like a club.</p> <p>He grabbed it and wrenched her arm until the branch dropped to the ground. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have time for this. I&#x2019;m no threat to you, Teresa.&#x201d;</p> <p>She punched him in the stomach.</p> <p>He muttered a curse and swung her around and shoved her up the path. &#x201c;I told you I was no threat. Get out of here. You have only a few minutes. I&#x2019;ll take care of Tantona and the others. Wait for me on the hill, and I&#x2019;ll look at that wound.&#x201d;</p> <p>She hesitated only for a second, then took off running again. She didn&#x2019;t know what was going on, but it couldn&#x2019;t be worse than what she was facing now. He was a stranger, but strangers couldn&#x2019;t be any more dangerous than those people with whom she&#x2019;d spent her entire life.</p> <p>Mother&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Don&#x2019;t think of her. It hurt too much.</p> <p>Keep running.</p> <p>She heard a scream behind her. Then a curse, then another sound that was like a grunt.</p> <p>Had Tantona killed him?</p> <p>The wet shrubs were striking her face as she ran up the hill.</p> <p>Get away. He had told her to wait, but he was probably a dead man.</p> <p>If he wasn&#x2019;t, he could be just as much a danger to her as the men who had shot her. She couldn&#x2019;t trust him. She couldn&#x2019;t trust anyone.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dammit, stop.&#x201d; The stranger&#x2019;s voice behind her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re okay now. No one&#x2019;s chasing you. Correction. No one but me. Stop.&#x201d;</p> <p>She kept running.</p> <p>Two minutes later, he tackled her from behind and took her down.</p> <p>She rolled over, and her fist struck out and hit his mouth. Then she butted her head up and struck his chest as hard as she could.</p> <p>Dizzy. Her head was spinning.</p> <p>But she tried to do it again.</p> <p>He muttered a curse as he straddled her and pinned her shoulders to the ground. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to hurt you, you little tarantula.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; she said fiercely, and moved her head, so that she could sink her teeth into his hand on her shoulder.</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t move but said through clenched teeth, &#x201c;Get your fangs out of me, or I&#x2019;ll knock you out and explain later. Do you want me to prove that I&#x2019;m not one of Camano&#x2019;s errand boys? I will. No problem. Let&#x2019;s go down the hill, and I&#x2019;ll show you their bodies.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stiffened and removed her teeth from his hand. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t prove you&#x2019;re not just as bad.&#x201d; She was silent, looking up at him. &#x201c;Did you really kill them?&#x201d;</p> <p>He shrugged. &#x201c;It was the only way to stop them. Camano had given them orders. He would have taken you alive, but he&#x2019;d be relieved if you were dead.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How do you know what Camano wants or doesn&#x2019;t want?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not because I belong to his fine organization. He&#x2019;s as dirty a gangster as your father was before him. I don&#x2019;t give a damn about him.&#x201d; He met her eyes. &#x201c;But I do give a damn about you. I want to help you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bullshit. I don&#x2019;t know you. Get off me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then let me introduce myself. My name is Andre Mandak. And I&#x2019;ll get off you if you promise you won&#x2019;t kick me in the nuts or run away. And if you&#x2019;ll let me take a look at that wound and stop the bleeding.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why would you want do anything to help me? I don&#x2019;t know you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve said that before. Maybe I&#x2019;m just a good Samaritan.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve said that before, too. I know you&#x2019;re scared, but think. I saved your life. Why would I want to take it now?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t trust you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t trust anyone. Deal with it. I&#x2019;m the only game in town.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stared up at him, then slowly nodded. &#x201c;Get off me.&#x201d;</p> <p>He swung off her and helped her to her feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you to my car on the road and see if I can stop that bleeding and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not getting into any car,&#x201d; she said flatly. &#x201c;And how do I know that you really did kill those men who were after me? Maybe it&#x2019;s a lie to trick me.&#x201d; She started back down the hill. &#x201c;I want to see them for myself.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; He followed her. &#x201c;Are you sure? Corpses aren&#x2019;t a pleasant sight.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have to know if you lied to me.&#x201d; Her hand was holding the wound in her side. It was wet with blood. Pain&nbsp;&#x2026; She had to keep on going. &#x201c;If you work for Camano, too, I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;d kill his men. It wouldn&#x2019;t make sense. So I might be able to trust you to&#x2014; No, but maybe I could&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped again. She wasn&#x2019;t thinking clearly. She whirled to face him. &#x201c;But you took away that club I had. If you really want to help me, give me your gun or something else to protect myself if you&#x2019;ve lied to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect that.&#x201d; He hesitated an instant. &#x201c;No gun, that would be too easy to turn against me.&#x201d; He reached in his jacket pocket and took out a long, slender dagger. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not enough to prove I&#x2019;m on your side?&#x201d; He gave the dagger to her. &#x201c;No, I guess not.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have to know that they&#x2019;re dead. Then I might be able to listen to you and decide what you want from me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And someone is always wanting something from you, aren&#x2019;t they, Teresa?&#x201d; he asked quietly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re only sixteen. How long has it been going on?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;None of your business,&#x201d; she said jerkily. Don&#x2019;t give in to the weakness. Put one foot in front of the other. &#x201c;Where are Tantona and the others?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my business, or I wouldn&#x2019;t be here,&#x201d; he said roughly. &#x201c;And part of that business is keeping you alive. Will you give this up and let me stop that bleeding?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Where are they?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Behind those trees up ahead. You&#x2019;re running a big risk just to see if I&#x2019;m lying to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know. How else can I find out? You could be tricking me. But you could have killed me back there. I don&#x2019;t know why you didn&#x2019;t. Either way it&#x2019;s a risk. I can&#x2019;t trust anyone. But I have to find out for sure who I have to fight.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;By all means, go check them out. Considering the fact that your dirtbag father raised you as a Mafia princess, I&#x2019;m sure you shouldn&#x2019;t be shocked at a few dead bodies.&#x201d;</p> <p>He was angry, she realized. Were those words supposed to hurt her? It didn&#x2019;t matter. Nothing mattered but finding a way to get away from Camano.</p> <p>She faded to the left when she reached the trees and tried to creep quietly forward in case there was someone in wait for her. Her hand tightened on the dagger. She stopped and listened.</p> <p>No sound.</p> <p>Her gaze searched the darkness.</p> <p>She went a few steps deeper into the trees.</p> <p>The first body she saw was that of Georgie Sohler. He was lying crumpled beside an oak tree. His head was twisted at an odd angle.</p> <p>Shock. She stopped short, then forced herself to keep on walking.</p> <p>A few yards later she saw Mick Judaro lying with eyes wide open staring at the sky.</p> <p>&#x201c;Seen enough?&#x201d; Mandak asked, behind her.</p> <p>She shook her head, moving forward.</p> <p>Tantona&#x2019;s throat had been cut, and there was a pool of blood on the ground around him.</p> <p>Dead. All dead.</p> <p>&#x201c;Satisfied?&#x201d; Andre Mandak asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Satisfied I&#x2019;m safe from them.&#x201d; She couldn&#x2019;t take her eyes from the wound in Tantona&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;Not satisfied that I&#x2019;m safe from you. You&#x2019;re a murderer like them. You killed them all in just a matter of minutes.&#x201d; She was dizzy, and it was hard to form the words. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re&nbsp;&#x2026; worse than they were.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Or better. It depends on how you look at it.&#x201d; He took a step closer to her. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not going to hurt you, dammit. Now let me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>Her knees were buckling. She was falling&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>He caught her before she reached the ground. He took the dagger from her hand. Then he lifted her and was carrying her through the trees.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let me&nbsp;&#x2026; down.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No way. I&#x2019;ve wasted enough time already. I can&#x2019;t be sure that Tantona didn&#x2019;t phone a location to Camano while he was chasing you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Camano already&nbsp;&#x2026; knew I was at the cabin. That&#x2019;s why he sent them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How did he know?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She&nbsp;&#x2026; told him.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My mother.&#x201d; It hurt to say the words. &#x201c;She&nbsp;&#x2026; told him.&#x201d;</p> <p>He was silent. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m&nbsp;&#x2026; sure.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Son of a <i>bitch.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>He was angry again. She didn&#x2019;t think that it was with her this time&nbsp;&#x2026; &#x201c;What are you going to do to me?&#x201d; She moistened her lips, then said fiercely, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let you kill me. I&#x2019;m not going to die. Do you hear me? I&#x2019;ll fight you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you will. You&#x2019;re ready to fight the whole damn world.&#x201d; He was looking straight ahead. &#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t listen. I&#x2019;m not going to hurt you. I&#x2019;m your best hope to stay alive.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;If you help me, Camano will kill you.&#x201d;</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t answer.</p> <p>And she didn&#x2019;t care. She was getting dizzy again. It might be okay to hope that he didn&#x2019;t want to hurt her or kill her and just let go&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>&#x201c;You were wrong about me,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only saw one man who had been murdered before tonight. But he was shot in the head. Hideous&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Your father did it?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jokman&#x2019;s skull exploding and blood and brains blowing in all directions.</p> <p>Guilt. Terrible guilt.</p> <p>Scream. She had screamed&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>&#x201c;No, I did it. It was me&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Darkness.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>GLITTERING STARS. TALL TREES. Wisps of smoke.</p> <p>A crackling fire only a few feet away.</p> <p>And Andre Mandak was kneeling beside her, his gaze focused intently on the bandage he was applying to the wound in her side. He looked up as he felt her stiffen. &#x201c;Back with me? I was beginning to worry. You lost quite a bit of blood. The wound isn&#x2019;t all that bad, just a flesh wound. But you probably suffered shock.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;After I stopped the blood, I drove twenty or thirty miles down the road and set up camp to finish the job.&#x201d; He was buttoning up her shirt. &#x201c;You need blood, but it&#x2019;s not urgent. I&#x2019;ll get you to someone I trust to check my first aid within the next twelve hours or so.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t anticipate any complaints. I&#x2019;m pretty damn good.&#x201d;</p> <p>She shook her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re crazy. I&#x2019;m not going to take that chance. I don&#x2019;t know or trust you. Why should I trust your friend?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No reason. Except that from now on I&#x2019;m going to run the show.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way it has to be,&#x201d; he said as he moved a few yards away from her. &#x201c;Unless you particularly want Camano to kill you or get his hands on you. Neither would be pleasant. I understand that he has certain ambitions in which he thinks you might be a help or hindrance.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I can run. I can hide. I don&#x2019;t need you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The hell you don&#x2019;t. If I help you, you&#x2019;ll survive. If I don&#x2019;t, you may last six months.&#x201d; He smiled and coaxed, &#x201c;Come on, Teresa. Use me. People have been using you for most of your life. It&#x2019;s your turn now.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stared at him. He had suddenly turned from brutal frankness to a charisma that was almost mesmerizing. She had only been vaguely aware of him as a man since he had appeared in her life tonight. He had only been a threat and a puzzle and the faint stirring of hope.</p> <p>Close-cut dark hair, blue eyes beneath slashing dark brows, high cheekbones, and a beautifully shaped sensual mouth. How old? Late twenties? Early thirties? He was dressed in dark jeans and sweatshirt that revealed he was lean but muscular and very strong in spite of his slimness. He had carried her with no problem at all. &#x201c;Who are you? Not your name, Mandak. Who are you to me?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who am I?&#x201d; He thought about it. &#x201c;Your savior? Your teacher? Anything else will have to be worked out between us.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Savior?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I killed three men for you tonight. Doesn&#x2019;t that qualify?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How did you even know I was in those woods tonight?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting&nbsp;&#x2026; and watching. I knew it was going to happen soon.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What? How?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Because it wasn&#x2019;t reasonable that they&#x2019;d let you go peacefully. It would have been too dangerous for Camano.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that your mother was involved.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about her,&#x201d; she said shakily. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t mean for anyone to hurt me. She loves me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Very well. But I had to know if she&#x2019;s a threat.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why? Why do you have to know anything? Who the hell are you? How do I know that you won&#x2019;t try to sell me to Camano? I don&#x2019;t <i>know</i> you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But I know you. I&#x2019;ve been watching you for a long time.&#x201d; He held up his hand as she opened her lips to speak. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you as much as I can. I&#x2019;ve been keeping an eye on your father and his relationship with you for the last few years after it came to my attention.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stiffened. &#x201c;What came to your attention?&#x201d;</p> <p>He only stared at her.</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she said through clenched teet...</p></p><h2>Print &amp; Pattern 2</h2><p>Patterns are everywhere, an antidote to gloomy economic times, we see them creeping over shop fronts, packaging design, clothes and home accessories.

Inc., a customized online program that motivates people to change their normal to a healthier one.&nbsp; PEPPER SCHWARTZ received her Ph.D. in sociology from Yale University, is a Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington, and is the author of 16 books.&nbsp; JAMES WITTE, a Harvard Ph.D., is the Professor of Sociology and Director of the Center for Social Science Research at George Mason University.&nbsp;</p>Chapter 1<br><br>The Normal Bar Is . . .<br><br>Are you normal in the way you conduct your relationship?<br><br>If you&#x2019;re like most of the people we asked, the answer is no--or at least you hope you&#x2019;re not. &#x201c;Being normal is boring, and I&#x2019;m not boring,&#x201d; was the sentiment we heard most often. Many people, in fact, told us they&#x2019;d do almost anything to avoid being &#x201c;normal.&#x201d;<br><br>But suppose we asked, &#x201c;In your interaction with your significant other, are you extremely happy and sexually satisfied the majority of the time?&#x201d; If normal means being happy and sexually satisfied, you&#x2019;d probably like to be able to answer yes. So the next question is, how can you attain--and sustain--this kind of normal? Or, put another way, what are the real life keys to a happy relationship?<br><br>These questions lie at the heart of The Normal Bar. We set out to ask people around the world, first, what are the most common attitudes and practices in relationships, or what constitutes the &#x201c;bar&#x201d; of normalcy; second, how do the &#x201c;normal bars&#x201d; of satisfied and dissatisfied couples typically differ; and, finally, what can we learn from these different understandings of normal to help people change their relationships for the better?<br><br>As you&#x2019;ll see from our findings, what people are assumed to be doing in private often bears little or no resemblance to what they actually do. Cultural stereotypes and the media&#x2019;s fantasies of romance and lust have little to do with what really goes on in relationships, especially since conduct varies over time and across geographic boundaries. Our goal, then, was to drill deep, through and beyond common assumptions, to find out just how typical different romantic and domestic habits truly are--and how different interpretations of behavior correlate with personal and relationship happiness. For instance:<br><br>* Does the average couple kiss once a day, once a week, once a month, or even less--and how does the frequency of kissing line up with their satisfaction in the relationship?<br><br>* Is everyone having a lot of sex--or is that level of intimacy pretty rare for everyone except newlyweds?<br><br>* Does money still predict who makes the rules in a relationship, or have things changed radically as women have become an increasingly important part of the workforce?<br><br>* How often do we lie to our partners; and is honesty really the best way to keep peace in the household?<br><br>We created an unprecedented interactive relationship survey (see our Appendix for details about the precise methodology) that asked each participant hundreds of questions about the inner workings of compatibility, romance, affection, communication, sex, money, daily decision making, and emotional connection. Then, by linking the survey through Web sites with millions of viewers--such sites as AARP, Huffington Post, Reader&#x2019;s Digest, and AOL--we collected data from more than 70,000 men and women around the world (in countries including Canada, England, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and China). Finally, as the data streamed in, we mapped behavior globally and tracked the patterns and averages, so that readers could pinpoint exactly where they lined up on the Normal Bar of personal and relationship happiness.<br><br>Think of the Normal Bar as a tool you can use to compare different areas of your relationship with typical behavior among others in your age, gender, or cultural group. (We&#x2019;ll break these group norms down for you, and you may be surprised to see how they differ.) Each of the chapters to come will examine aspects of couples&#x2019; lives that affect their happiness and overall satisfaction, from their first weeks and months together, through the day-to-day strains of living together, to the challenges that may threaten their staying together long term. If you find that your own normal in a particular area isn&#x2019;t working for your relationship, look to the Normal Bar to see what typically works best for others.<br><br>To maximize the usefulness of this information, in each chapter we&#x2019;ll also suggest simple tools or exercises that can help you and your partner reduce conflict, resentment, and stress. &#x201c;Normal&#x201d; habits often outlive their usefulness, but the good news is that most couples can, if they choose, rejuvenate their love at any age by creating a new normal. The Normal Bar offers the practical advice you&#x2019;ll need to make this shift.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t worry: We&#x2019;re not saying that you have to be &#x201c;normal&#x201d; to have a thriving love life, but we will show you which behaviors tend to make for the happiest and strongest couples. You can then use this information to reassess and refine your relationship to your own specifications. Our goal is simply to give you a compass and a toolbox to help move your personal normal into the zone your heart desires.<br>How Does the Normal Bar Work?<br><br>&#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t do everything, nothing gets done.&#x201d;-- female, 38, separated after a 12-year marriage<br><br>Let&#x2019;s look at a simplified real-life example of how the Normal Bar process works. Behold Bob and Andrea, the full-time working parents of twelve-year-old Jack. Every day for the last thirteen years, Andrea has done all the family laundry. She thought that was normal, so her position on the Normal Bar for laundry is clear: she bears 100% of her family&#x2019;s laundry duty. Bob and Jack, on the other hand, are sitting pretty at 0% of that responsibility.<br><br>Over the years, however, Andrea has become resentful of this norm. She doesn&#x2019;t complain or say anything about it, but she&#x2019;s started to snap at Jack and Bob whenever they ask for clean socks. The guys, meanwhile, have no idea what&#x2019;s gotten into Andrea. It seems like such a minor issue. They dismiss her growing agitation, but that only increases Andrea&#x2019;s resentment. When Bob can&#x2019;t find his boxers, she lays into him for even asking where they are. The emotional climate in the house is getting worse, but to Andrea, Bob, and Jack it&#x2019;s a mystery why. They all assume it&#x2019;s normal for the wife and mother to do all the laundry, so this can&#x2019;t possibly be the real problem--or can it?<br><br>Desperate, Andrea takes a poll of her girlfriends, asking if they do all the laundry in their households. She learns that, while a majority of the wives do all the laundry, there are actually a handful of husbands who do it, and some husbands and wives split the chore--in a few cases, the older kids in the house even help. Most important, from just this small sampling, Andrea learns that a lot of the couples who share the chore seem to have happier relationships than those in which the wife bears the whole burden 100% of the time. Not only is a different normal possible, but it looks like a different normal might be a better normal all around! Armed with this insight, Andrea sees a new way forward.<br><br>She gathers her courage and tells her husband and son what she&#x2019;s learned from her friends and how she feels about doing the laundry. To her surprise, Bob and Jack are relieved that the problem isn&#x2019;t something more serious. Bob was starting to think that Andrea was unhappy with him or the relationship, not ever imagining that she was just sick of doing the laundry every day. The solution? Bob and Jack agree to share the responsibility, and Andrea&#x2019;s new normal becomes just a third of her previous duty. This is a norm she can happily accept on an ongoing basis.<br>Opening the Normal Bar Tool Kit<br>The smallest issue can erode or even destroy a relationship if it becomes a norm that one of the partners resents. Realizing that a different normal is possible is a vital first step toward addressing the issue and having a clear alternative in mind always makes the process of change less intimidating. But it&#x2019;s not always easy to make the leap from a long-established norm to a preferable one. Old habits sometimes die hard, and your partner might not be as willing to change as you are. That&#x2019;s why we offer true stories, advice, and tools in every chapter in this book to help you and your partner get to your new normal.<br><br>These suggestions are culled from the tactics and exercises our respondents have used most effectively to improve overall satisfaction and sexual connection in their relationships. After analyzing our data and hearing how our happiest couples solved problems, we were astounded by the simplicity of many of these practices and the ease with which they can be woven into daily life. Even a small adjustment can make a big change and can turn a pattern of habits that couples don&#x2019;t like into one that supports them and their relationships. Some of the tools might seem obvious to you when you read about them, but what&#x2019;s not obvious is the critical difference they can make to a relationship when actually used. For instance, knowing that your partner likes to be told &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; is one thing; actually saying &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; is quite another. Seemingly minor changes can make the difference between living happily ever after together, breaking up, or, worse, staying together and never feeling completely fulfilled.<br><br>Think of personal hygiene as an analogy. We&#x2019;ve all been told that people who floss their teeth are less likely than non-flossers to have plaque buildup and cavities. But let&#x2019;s pretend that we&#x2019;ve surveyed thousands of people and learned that those who don&#x2019;t floss every day have a 75% greater chance of having their teeth fall out. Maybe because you knew flossing was good for your teeth you normally flossed from time to time, but after hearing this startling data, wouldn&#x2019;t you consider making daily flossing part of your normal routine? Minor adjustments in your &#x201c;relationship hygiene&#x201d; can also make a big difference in your health as a couple.<br><br>Emphasizing the importance of certain behaviors by presenting new and convincing data about those behaviors is the heart and soul of this book. We&#x2019;ll share the insights and experiences of people all over the world. And while the advice and strategies for constructing a new normal may appear simple, never doubt their potential to help you achieve real change.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s get started!<br>PART I<br><br>Getting Together<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Are You the One for Me?<br><br>The instant I saw her I knew we were meant for each other. It was love at first sight.<br><br>Doesn&#x2019;t that sound romantic? Such electric moments are a staple of love stories, and many of us grow up believing they&#x2019;re the truest sign of &#x201c;true&#x201d; love. So we wanted to know: Do these moments actually occur in real life?<br><br>Yes! At least they did for 28% of women and 48% of men in our survey. The sharp difference between the sexes might surprise you, but it&#x2019;s actually in line with other research that shows men are more romantic than women, more likely to fall in love because of the way a potential partner looks, and more likely to feel love when there is extreme sexual attraction. Women tend to be more wary, and most need to know more about a partner&#x2019;s character and background before they&#x2019;ll allow the deeper emotions to develop.<br><br>But what about the premium we place on love at first sight? Does this immediate charge correlate to happier long-term relationships? Not in overall contentment, according to the Normal Bar. Those who have eased into love gradually are just as likely to be happy together as those who were hit by a lightning bolt of passion on day one.<br><br>There is, however, one critical area where that initial lightning bolt seems to leave an enduring impact: People who fell in love at first sight are more likely than gradual lovers to claim satisfaction with their present sex life--even after decades together! In fact, the group most likely to report this sexual boon was middle-aged men and women between the ages of 45 and 54. This might indicate that intense attraction early on in the relationship was especially important for the last group of baby boomers. More likely, it means that love at first sight is a strong gauge of sexual interest that will stand the test of time.<br>Are You with Your Soul Mate?<br>Love, of course, involves more than attraction--more even than sexual satisfaction. Compatibility is a crucial element as well. Many of us grew up absorbing the message--from fairy tales, Disney movies, romance novels, and perhaps our families--that &#x201c;true&#x201d; love depends on finding the one &#x201c;true&#x201d; mate who is meant for us: our &#x201c;soul mate.&#x201d; But what does this mean?<br><br>The term soul mate has become a popular concept relatively recently and is now widespread--and aspirational. We found that most people think of soul mates as two people who are &#x201c;right for&#x201d; each other and belong together. But beyond this sense of belonging, there are some important conceptual variations.<br><br>Those who are religious might add more spiritual--and permanent--criteria. &#x201c;Till death do us part,&#x201d; after all, is standard language in marriage vows exchanged in most churches. We compared people by religion and found that people of all faiths believe in this concept. Furthermore, most religious people believe that they have found and are with their own soul mates!<br><br>Curiously, the percentage of soul mates drops significantly among nonbelievers and those not affiliated with a particular religion. Or perhaps they&#x2019;re just less inclined to identify their partners by that term. But while the religious divide is intriguing, the much more important news is that more than half of all people we asked said their current partners are their soul mates. Some believe in the one true soul mate concept, while others believe there could be several &#x201c;true&#x201d; mates for each person. Either way, a solid majority believe they&#x2019;re with the person they&#x2019;re meant to love.<br><br>So . . . are the people who believe they&#x2019;re with their soul mate more satisfied with their sex lives? Yes! Among the soul mated, 82% of men and 83% of women said they&#x2019;re very satisfied with their sex lives. Of course, first-rate sex could be one of the criteria for identifying your partner as a soul mate in the first place, but general happiness plays an important role as well. If having a soul mate means that your sexual and emotional lives are well in sync, then our findings suggest that there are a lot of very contented couples in the world.<br>We Are So Connected . . .<br><br>We&#x2019;ve all seen couples who appear to be obvious soul mates--who finish each other&#x2019;s sentences, look at each other lovingly, and just seem to be perfectly matched. Then there are those other couples, who always seem to be bickering, talking over each other, gesturing angrily or accusingly, couples we assume to be miserable only to find out this is just how they relate, and somehow it works for them. The truth is, none of us can judge another couple&#x2019;s happiness or know, from the outside, whether they should be together. So we decided to ask couples to tell us from their own perspectives what connects them.</p><h2>If Chaos Reigns: The Near-Disaster and Ultimate Triumph of the Allied Airborne Forces on D-Day, June 6, 1944</h2><p>&#x201c;Gentlemen, do not be daunted if chaos reigns; it undoubtedly will.&#x201d; So said Brigadier S. James Hill, commanding officer of the British 3rd Parachute Brigade, in an address to his troops shortly before the launching of Operation Overlord&#x2014;the D-Day invasion of Normandy. No more prophetic words were ever spoken, for chaos indeed reigned on that day, and many more that followed.<br><br>Much has been written about the Allied invasion of France, but award-winning military historian Flint Whitlock has put together a unique package&#x2014;the first history of the assault that concentrates exclusively on the activities of the American, British, and Canadian airborne forces that descended upon Normandy in the dark, pre-dawn hours of 6 June 1944. Landing into the midst of the unknown, the airborne troops found themselves fighting for their lives on every side in the very jaws of the German defenses, while striving to seize their own key objectives in advance of their seaborne comrades to come.<br><br>Whitlock details the formation, recruitment, training, and deployment of the Allies&#x2019; parachute and glider troops. First-person accounts by the veterans who were there&#x2014;from paratroopers to glidermen to the pilots who flew them into the battle, as well as the commanders (Eisenhower, Taylor, Ridgway, Gavin, and more)&#x2014;make for compelling, &#x201c;you-are-there&#x201d; reading. If Chaos Reigns is a fitting tribute to the men who rode the wind into battle and managed to pull victory out of confusion, chaos, and almost certain defeat.<br><br>Author/military historian Flint Whitlock graduated from the Army's Airborne School at Ft.

A <i>po�te maudit, </i>Jaime Saenz rejected the conventions of polite society and became a monk in service of his own imagination. Apocalyptic and occult in his politics, a denizen of slum taverns, unashamedly bisexual, insistently nocturnal in his artistic affairs, and secretive in his leadership of a select group of writers, Saenz mixed the mystical and baroque with the fantastic, the psychological, and the symbolic. In masterly translations by two poet-translators, Kent Johnson and Forrest Gander, Saenz's strange, innovative, and wildly lyrical poems reveal a literary legacy of fierce compassion and solidarity with indigenous Bolivian cultures and with the destitute, the desperate, and the disenfranchised of that unreal city, La Paz.<br><br>In long lines, in odes that name desire, with Whitmanesque anaphora, in exclamations and repetitions, Saenz addresses the reader, the beloved, and death in one extended lyrical gesture. The poems are brazenly affecting. Their semantic innovation is notable in the odd heterogeneity of formal and tonal structures that careen unabashedly between modes and moods; now archly lyrical, now arcanely symbolic, now colloquial, now trancelike. As Saenz's reputation continues to grow throughout the world, these inspired translations and the accompanying Spanish texts faithfully convey the poet's unique vision and voice to English-speaking readers.<br><br></p><p>"<i>Immanent Visitor</i> is a triumphant procession of that hallucinated angel, Jaime Saenz, carried into English by Kent Johnson and Forrest Gander."&#x2015;Eliot Weinberger <br><br>"The appearance of Jaime Saenz in English is a major event for all of us who live and write within that language. In this authoritative selection and translation by Forrest Gander and Kent Johnson he enters the imagination of North America&#x2015;a later but crucial member of the pantheon of west coast South American poets that includes Neruda, Vallejo, Huidobro, and Parra. The poetry is relentless and the genius of the man who made it inescapable. For a poetry of awakening and terror, this is the place to look."&#x2015;Jerome Rothenberg <br><br>"These poems in translation are a revelation, a masterful conceit. 'Reading Saenz we are struck awake into a surging, polyphonic language of unstable, rapid transitions,' the poet/translators say, and so it is: a plain of shifting verbal sands, Saenz unfolds in their hands. The poem and the reader are both kept off-balance until they levitate into a trance, el momento of fusion where poetry begins. It is a great thing to witness this translation as event, the coming of Saenz into a new 'us,' a moment when poetry can be read as 'ours,' meaning 'north and south connected.'

As always a feeling of melancholy enveloped him as he drove down the two-lane highway lined with century-old crimson maples whose boughs intertwined and formed a shadowy tunnel across the road. The powerful engine hummed as he maneuvered the gentle twists and turns that led to the town. Will fished the cellular phone from his inside coat pocket and punched in a number.<br><br>"Mick," he said into the phone. "I'm sorry I'm late. I was hoping you'd still be at your shop." He smiled at the reply. "I'm less than five minutes away. Thanks." He punched the <i>end</i> button on the phone and returned it to his pocket.<br><br>The last vestiges of sunlight brushed the tops of the trees in the town square as he slid the Jaguar to the curb in front of Mick's Flower Shop. He hopped out and hurried into the shop. Mick sat behind the cash register counting the day's receipts. He looked up as he entered the store. "Afternoon, Will. It was nice of you to call, but I figured you'd still want the bouquet you ordered. I wasn't going anywhere until you arrived."<br><br>Will smiled as the white-haired old man rose from his chair and made his way to the walk-in cooler in the back of the shop. He emerged a few moments later holding a dozen yellow roses. "This okay, Will?" He held the bouquet lovingly in his hands. "Or should I call you Mr. Martin now that you're running the agency?" Mick's eyes crinkled up <br>at Will.<br><br>"Will will be fine," he replied, with a smile of his own. "The flowers look great, Mick. How much do I owe you?"<br><br>"Hmm, I suppose I ought to give you the same price I gave your grandfather. After all, I don't suppose I'd be in business if it weren't for him." Will lifted a quizzical eyebrow. "But that's another story for another day. Ten dollars."<br><br>"Are you sure? That seems awfully reasonable. Especially when I kept you open on Thanksgiving Day."<br><br>"Yup, ten dollars. That's the Martin price, including tax." The old man smiled. Will handed him a ten-dollar bill. "Thanks, Mick, I'd like to hear that story some time." He took the roses and raced back to the car. He glanced at his watch as the powerful engine pulled the car from the curb. <i>If I can make it to Julia's in five minutes, I'll be on time,</i> he thought. He steered through the light traffic around the town square and hurried down Olive Street to the new condominiums that had sprung up on the edge of town. He slid into a parking spot and hurried up the steps to Julia's front door.<br><br>Inside, Julia Welsch admired herself in the hall mirror. The dark red suit she wore accentuated her honey-blond hair. She leaned close to the mirror and inspected her face. Quickly she reached into her bag and applied a fresh dab of color to her lips. The grandfather clock chimed melodiously, as the doorbell rang. <i>Well, he's on time,</i> she smiled, <i>that's a first.</i> She picked up her dark green overcoat, opened the door, and accepted Will's kiss on the cheek.<br><br>"You look gorgeous," he said as he took her arm and led her to the waiting car.<br><br>"You don't look so bad yourself," she replied, sinking into the leather seat. <i>Maybe things are moving along at last,</i> Julia thought, <i>at least he's finally taking me home to meet his grandmother.</i><br><br>Will glanced at the woman sitting next to him. <i>I'm a lucky guy. I hope Gram approves of her.</i> He smiled at Julia as she examined herself in the mirror set in the sun visor. The Jaguar sped across town. Will turned into the circular drive in front of a two-story brick home bounded by neatly trimmed hedges. A covered porch ran the width of the house. The manicured lawn was covered with autumn leaves. The smell of wood smoke hung in the air as Will helped Julia from the car. Immediately the front door flew open and Ruth Martin stepped onto the porch. She was wearing a dark blue dress that set off her silver hair. Although seventy-five years of age, she looked ten years younger. Will hugged her, handed her the roses, and kissed her cheek. "Gram, this is Julia Welsch." Ruth Martin smiled broadly and held Julia's hands in hers as she looked into the young woman's clear blue eyes.<br><br>"Come in, come in," she said, as she led them into the foyer of her home. "Will, it's so good to have you home for the holidays this year."<br><br>"It's good to be here."<br><br>"Dinner's ready. Why don't you get Miss Welsch seated in the dining room and then help me bring in the food from the kitchen."<br><br>Will led Julia through the living room, through the French doors, and into the dining room. The table was set with the pale ivory linen cloth and the crystal he knew would be there. This meal always began the holiday season for the Martin family, and the menu never varied. He pulled out a chair for Julia. "I'll be right back," he whispered as she took her seat.<br><br>Julia inspected the dining room while she waited. The Spode china reflected her perfect face as she gazed across the room at the painting of Warren Martin hanging on the wall above the sideboard. Two elegant silver candelabra bracketed the picture. Julia turned to find a similar painting of Ruth Martin on the wall behind her. She examined the silverware and noticed that the handle of each knife was engraved with the family crest. She thought of the handsome man helping his grandmother in the kitchen and smiled a deep, satisfied smile. <i>Thirty-two years is long enough for him to be single.</i><br><br>The kitchen door swung open and Will appeared, his cheeks flushed from the steaming, roasted turkey he carried. He placed it on the table as his grandmother appeared balancing a bowl of mashed potatoes in one hand and cranberry jelly in the other. Quickly the rest of the food was retrieved from the kitchen.<br><br>"Will, you're the man of the house now. Please say a blessing on the food, and thank the Lord for all the good things He's given us this year." She placed the vase of yellow roses in the middle of the table and quietly bowed her head.<br>Will cleared his throat and offered a prayer of thanksgiving. When he finished, he looked at his grandmother's face and saw the hint of a tear in her eye. He began to carve the turkey.<br><br>They chatted as they ate, speaking companionably about family and work and cultural interests, punctuated by compliments to Ruth about the feast they were enjoying. As they were finishing their pumpkin pie, Julia said, "Mrs. Martin, did you know that I'm in charge of the Country Club Christmas Ball this year?"<br><br>"Oh, how nice. Is this your first time?" Ruth asked.<br><br>"Yes, and I've had such great support from the community. Everyone seems so excited about the dance. It's a chance to put on our Christmas finery and help support the development of a new children's wing at the hospital. I'm delighted to be a part of it."<br><br>"I'm sure you are," Ruth said, smiling.<br><br>"We've asked for RSVPs, you know. The caterers just have to have some idea of the number of people they're going to serve. I mean, you just couldn't have them run out of food, now, could you?" Julia asked with a knowing look in Ruth's direction. "Will," she continued, as she lowered her eyes and looked at him, "I haven't seen your RSVP yet, but I'm sure it's not necessary. I'm certain I'm going to make everyone else jealous with the handsomest man in town at my side."<br><br>Will glanced at his grandmother, an embarrassed look on his face.<br><br>"What about you, Mrs. Martin. Will you be joining us at the ball?" Julia beamed in her direction.<br><br>A shadow crossed Ruth Martin's face. "I haven't made up my mind. I'm not sure I'm ready to get back into the social whirl quite yet."<br><br>"But it will be the event of the season," persisted Julia."You really must come."<br><br>"Thank you for your kind invitation," Ruth replied quietly. "I'll just have to see how I feel."<br><br>The smile hardened on Julia's face. "I'll put you down as a yes. The evening just won't be complete without you." In the uncomfortable silence that followed, Julia turned to Will. "Guess who called me today."<br><br>Will shook his head. "I'm sure I can't imagine."</p><h2>The Singer&#39;s Musical Theatre Anthology - Volume 5: Mezzo-Soprano Book/Online Audio (Singer&#39;s Musical Theatre Anthology (Songbooks))</h2><p>(Vocal Collection).

At the end of the thirteenth century, after their withdrawal from Syria, they became the apparently innocent victims of a campaign of slander and persecution mounted against them by the French government. <br><br>The ruthless dissolution of the Knights Templar was only the beginning of a new and strange chapter in their history. They soon became the focus of numerous beliefs about their presumed occult powers, and by the eighteenth century their history had undergone a mythical metamorphosis--they figured highly in occult fantasies of magical practices and hidden knowledge as well as in the romance of the Gothic novel, with its frequent tales of monastic impropriety. <br><br>In this widely praised book, author Peter Partner elucidates the history of the Templars as well as the beliefs that have developed around them in more recent times. From the tangled traditions of occultism to concepts of crusading chivalry, from political conspiracy to governmental greed and papal corruption, Partner shows how a medieval act of political injustice grew into a modern fantasy.</p><p>Peter Partner, Ph.D. is the author of several books and articles on medieval and Renaissance history. He has worked as a journalist in Italy, the Middle East, and North Africa, and has taught at Winchester College (England) since 1955.<b>That Odd Mary Magdalene<br></b> <br>It seems that even among Jesus&#x2019; disciples, Mary played a privileged role. Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>Space Vampire (Choose Your Own Adventure#71)</h2><p>When a group of vicious, deadly extraterrestrial vampires invades the solar system it is up to the reader to save earth from their onslaught, in this multiple-plot adventure.</p><p></p><h2>House Revenge: A Joe DeMarco Thriller (The Joe DeMarco Thrillers, 11)</h2><p>In <i>House Revenge</i>, Congressional fixer Joe DeMarco is dispatched to his boss Congressman John Mahoney&#x2019;s hometown of Boston.

But after a year of grueling training under the eyes of British Commando instructors, the 29th Rangers were suddenly dissolved.

THE REMAINS OF THE DAY<br></p><p>Jack Womer is a World War II veteran of high distinction. Jack was drafted into the 29th Infantry Division in April of 1941, and sent to Europe in October of 1942. Jack volunteered for the 29th Ranger Battalion, undertook training by British Commandos, and was among the relatively few men who met the extensive and rigorous requirements for becoming a Ranger. After the 29th Rangers disbanded in October of 1943, Jack volunteered to become a paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division and, in January, 1944, was assigned to the Division&#x2019;s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment&#x2019;s Demolitions Platoon, in the section known infamously as the&#x201c;Filthy Thirteen&#x201d;. He fought with the Filthy Thirteen in the Invasion of Normandy (D-Day), the Battle for Holland, and the Battle of the Bulge. Arguably the Filthy Thirteen's best soldier, Jack credits his not being injured and surviving the war to his Ranger training and God. Jack was eventually made buck sergeant of the Filthy Thirteen, a position which he held until the end of the war.&#x201c;In this long awaited memoir by one of the squad&#x2019;s integral members, Jack Womer reveals his own inside account of fighting as a spearhead of the Screaming Eagles in Normandy, Holland, and the Battle of the Bulge.

Inspired by the storytelling possibilities of digital photograph manipulation, he developed a unique style of photo-illustration. He lives with his wife, two Border collies, cats, and a transient population of wild and not-so-wild animals (some of whom are pictured in this book) on a small farm in the beautiful KwaZulu-Natal midlands of South Africa. <i>The Little Red Hen</i> is his first book.PreSchool-Grade 1-Downard presents a new rendition of the classic story in which the lazy duck, pig, and cat refuse to help the resourceful hen. This version elaborates a bit on how the bread is a "delicious golden brown color" and in the end the hen eats it all by herself, not with her chicks as in some retellings. However, what really sets this book apart is its modern and witty artwork. The collage photographs are generated with the assistance of a computer with delightful results. In one scene, the three animals are playing pool; another shows the little red hen riding a bicycle and wearing a helmet, glasses, and red rain boots; and in another illustration, the cat has headphones. The creative pictures are fun to pore over and will catch the interest of kids slightly older than the traditional audience for this tale.<i>-Linda M.

But suppose if an American girl were born with abilities in chess that matched the greatest players. What would happen to her in a highly competitive field dominated by men? Starting from this premise, the author Walter Tevis, who some years ago interested a generation of Americans in straight pool with the book &#x201c;The Hustler&#x201d;, has produced a riveting novel that makes chess more exciting than one could have imagined. Orphaned at eight when both of her parents are killed in a car accident, Beth is sent to the Methuen Home. A frightened little girl, she survives on the tranquilizers the home doles out to make the children &#x201c;easier to handle&#x201d;. She is sent to the basement to get chalkboard erasers and she finds players sitting with a checkerboard with strange little pieces on it. She is strangely fascinated and she keeps coming back to the basement to watch. She has learned the moves by herself and keeps coming to watch by a desire she hardly understands. She overcomes her shyness and a janitor teaches her the moves. From that moment on, although she does not at once realize it, her whole life has forever changed. Eight year-old orphan Beth Harmon is quiet, sullen, and by all appearances unremarkable. That is until she plays her first game of chess. Her senses grow sharper, her thinking clearer, and for the first time in her life she feels herself fully in control. By the age of sixteen, she's competing for the U.S. Open championship. But as she hones her skills on the professional circuit, the stakes get higher, her isolation grows more frightening, and the thought of escape becomes all the more tempting. Engaging and fast-paced, The Queen's Gambit speeds to a conclusion as elegant and satisfying as a mate in four. The book is all fiction.

PW ran the first nonfiction list 17 years later. Today, bestseller lists galvanize the publishing industry, much as their cousins do the film and recording industries, among others. Of the several books written about bestseller lists (most notably, Alice Payne Hackett and James Henry Burke's 80 Years of Best Sellers, 1977), this is the most perceptive and not surprisingly, given Korda's literary abilities, which have led to his own run of bestselling books the most engaging. The engagement arises from Korda's erudite yet conversational tone, leavened with humor and smartly opinionated (e.g., the 1958 nonfiction bestseller list, he writes, "remained the kind of thumping, predictable bore it had been through most of the fifties"). The perceptivity arises not only because Korda, longtime editor in chief of S&amp;S, knows just about all that's worth knowing about books, but because he approaches the lists as the subtitle indicates. Decade by decade, he examines the annual hardcover lists drawn from PW beginning with 1913 to see how the books people buy embody the cultural tenor of the times. "Like a mirror," he writes, "[the list] reflects who we are, what we want, what interests us...." Korda finds, for instance, that "[books about] better sex, more sex, plus tabletop cooking, says something about the priorities of Americans in the first year of Richard Nixon's presidency.... People were looking for domestic happiness, in retreat from the... conflicts of the sixties.... " As Korda charts changes in America via the bestseller list, he demonstrates that reading tastes haven't altered all that much; as background to that charting, he presents a useful, compact history of the publishing industry. Witty and deeply informed, this is a bracing, even essential, read for anyone who loves books.

Are we merely subject to the whim of forces beyond our control? Or, in the face of constant disruption, can we build better shock absorbers&#x2014;for ourselves, our communities, our economies, and for the planet as a whole? <br><br>The answers to these vital questions are shaping a new field of inquiry, and a new agenda, focused on <i>resilience</i>: the ability of people, communities, and systems to maintain their core purpose and integrity amid unforeseen shocks and surprises. By encouraging adaptation, agility, and cooperation, this new approach can not only help us weather disruptions, but also bring us to a different way of being in and engaging with the world. <br><br>Reporting firsthand from the coral reefs of Palau to the back streets of Palestine, Andrew Zolli and Ann Marie Healy relate breakthrough scientific discoveries, pioneering social and ecological innovations, and important new approaches to constructing a more resilient world. Along the way, they share insights to bolster our own psychological resilience, foster greater stability within our communities, and establish leadership imperatives for more resilient organizations. Zolli and Healy show how this new concept of resilience is a powerful lens through which we can assess major issues afresh: from business planning to social development, from urban planning to national energy security&#x2014;circumstances that affect us all. <br><br>Provocative, optimistic, and eye-opening, <i>Resilience </i>sheds light on why some systems, people, and communities fall apart in the face of disruption and, ultimately, how they can learn to bounce back.</p><p><b>Andrew Zolli </b>directs the global innovation network PopTech and has served as a fellow of the National Geographic Society.

On this day, the price of corn&#x2014;the main ingredient in tortillas&#x2014;would hit an all-time high of 35 cents a pound, a price that would have been unfathomable just a year before. Corn was suddenly 400 percent more expensive than it had been just three months earlier. With half of all Mexicans living below the poverty line, a sudden increase of this magnitude was not just a nuisance, it was a potential humanitarian and political crisis.<br> <br>As the sun lifted higher in the sky, the voices of tens of thousands of citizens, farmers, and union activists could be heard gathering in one of the city&#x2019;s central squares. Above their heads, they raised not weapons, but ears of corn. The tortilla riots, as they came to be called, echoed throughout the day, taking over one of the main downtown streets and challenging the new government of President Felipe Calder�n. Well into the evening, protestors chanted, &#x201c;Tortillas s�, pan no!&#x201d;&#x2014;a pun on Calder�n&#x2019;s National Action Party, the PAN, which also means &#x201c;bread&#x201d; in Spanish&#x2014;and barked out their suspicions about just who was behind the rise in prices: the government, big business, and the wealthy elite of the country. Union leaders and television celebrities railed against corporations for price fixing and chastised the beef and pig ranchers for hoarding their grains.<br> <br>While the ranchers and political leaders were natural objects of class indignation, they were not, this time at least, the principal culprits. Indeed, the protestors could scarcely have guessed the truth: The slowly burning fuse that had ignited the explosion in corn prices had been lit several years before and a thousand miles away by a seemingly disconnected event&#x2014;Hurricane Katrina.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s how: In August 2005, the impending winds of the devastating hurricane had prompted the mass evacuation and shutdown of the 2,900 oil rigs that dot the Gulf Coast from Texas to Louisiana, disrupting almost 95 percent of oil production in the Gulf for several months. In the aftermath of the storm, the price of gasoline in America surged, in some places by as much as 40 cents per gallon in a single day. This spike in oil prices made corn&#x2014;the primary ingredient in the alternative fuel ethanol&#x2014;look relatively cheap by comparison and spurred investment in domestic ethanol production. U.S. farmers, among the most efficient and most heavily subsidized in the world, were encouraged to replace their edible corn crops with inedible varieties suitable for ethanol production. By 2007, even Congress had gotten in on the act, mandating a fivefold increase in biofuel production&#x2014;with more than 40 percent of it to come from corn.<br> <br>Amid the euphoria of this ethanol investment bubble, almost no one considered potential impacts on Mexico&#x2019;s peasant farmers, who, in the decade between the passage of NAFTA and the arrival of Katrina, had found themselves thrust into international competition with powerhouse U.S. agribusinesses north of their border. American corn growers routinely sold (many would argue dumped) their product on Mexican markets at almost 20 percent less than it cost to produce it. Unable to keep up&#x2014;even with the support of their own domestic subsidies&#x2014;many rural Mexican farmers had switched the variety of corn they grew, switched crops altogether, or abandoned their farms, swelling the ranks of Mexico City&#x2019;s underclass and further accelerating Mexico&#x2019;s position as a primary market for cheap U.S. varieties.<br> <br>As NAFTA took hold, this expanding corn import market had also become increasingly dominated by a tiny clique of powerful transnational corporations, mostly headquartered in the United States, including Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, along with their Mexican subsidiaries. These companies accelerated the transition already at work by doing what dominant incumbents instinctively do: concentrating power, tightening their control over the market, and squeezing out smaller suppliers. The result: Mexico, famous as the place that domesticated the growing of corn ten thousand years ago, soon became a net food importer&#x2014;and the third largest of U.S. agricultural products&#x2014;much of it channeled through a tiny constellation of companies.<br> <br>It was against this backdrop that, in the year that followed Katrina, with increasing amounts of the United States&#x2019; domestic supply being diverted to ethanol, the price of corn became inextricably coupled to the price of oil&#x2014;not only because ethanol and oil are comparable fuels, but also because it takes an enormous amount of petroleum-derived fertilizers to grow corn in the first place. As the price of a barrel of petroleum fluctuated, the price of a bushel of corn began increasingly to move in lockstep. When global speculation drove the cost of a barrel of oil to nearly $140, the now-linked price of corn also skyrocketed, provoking what may become an archetypal experience of the twenty-first century: a food riot.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>We are, of course, used to these kinds of stories. Each week, it seems, brings some unforeseen disruption, blooming amid the thicket of overlapping social, political, economic, technological, and environmental systems that govern our lives. They arrive at a quickening yet erratic pace, usually from unexpected quarters, stubbornly resistant to prediction. The most severe become cultural touchstones, referred to in staccato shorthand: Katrina. Haiti. BP. Fukushima. The Crash. The Great Recession. The London mob. The Arab Spring. Other nameless disruptions swell their ranks, amplified by slowly creeping vulnerabilities: a midwestern town is undone by economic dislocation; a company is obliterated by globalization; a way of life is rendered impossible by an ecological shift; a debt crisis emerges from political intractability. If it feels like the pace of these disruptions is increasing, it&#x2019;s not just you: It took just six months for 2011 to become the costliest year on record for natural disasters, a fact that insurance companies tie unambiguously to climate change. Volatility of all sorts has become the new normal, and it&#x2019;s here to stay.<br> <br>While the details are always different, certain features of these disruptions are remarkably consistent, whether we&#x2019;re discussing the recent global financial crisis, the geopolitical outcomes of the war in Iraq, or the surprising consequences of a natural disaster. One hallmark of such events is that they reveal the dependencies between spheres that are more often studied and discussed in isolation from one another. The story of the tortilla riots, for example, makes visible the linkages between the energy system (the oil rigs) the ecological system (Katrina), the agricultural system (the corn harvest), the global trade system (NAFTA), social factors (urbanization and poverty), and the political systems of both Mexico and the United States.<br> <br>We tell such stories to encourage humility in the face of the incomprehensible complexity, interconnectivity, and volatility of the modern world&#x2014;one in which upheavals can appear to be triggered by seemingly harmless events, arrive with little warning, and reveal hidden, almost absurd correlations in their wake. Like pulling on an errant string in a garment, which unravels the whole even as it reveals how the elements were previously woven together, we make sense of these stories only in retrospect. Even with a deep understanding of the individual systems involved, we usually find it difficult to untangle the chain of causation at work. And for all of the contributions of the much-ballyhooed Information Age, just having more data doesn&#x2019;t automatically help. After all, if we could actually see each of the individual packets of data pulsing through the Internet, or the complex chemical interactions affecting our climate, could we make sense of them? Could we predict in detail over the long term where those systems are headed or what strange consequences might be unleashed along the way? Even with perfect knowledge, one can&#x2019;t escape the nagging suspicion we&#x2019;re ballroom dancing in the middle of a minefield.<br> <br>So what to do?<br> <br>If we cannot control the volatile tides of change, we can learn to build better boats. We can design&#x2014;and redesign&#x2014;organizations, institutions, and systems to better absorb disruption, operate under a wider variety of conditions, and shift more fluidly from one circumstance to the next. To do that, we need to understand the emerging field of resilience.<br> <br>Around the world, in disciplines as seemingly disconnected as economics, ecology, political science, cognitive science, and digital networking, scientists, policymakers, technologists, corporate leaders, and activists alike are asking the same basic questions: What causes one system to break and another to rebound? How much change can a system absorb and still retain its integrity and purpose? What characteristics make a system adaptive to change? In an age of constant disruption, how do we build in better shock absorbers for ourselves, our communities, companies, economies, societies, and the planet?<br> <br>Like a developing Polaroid, the insights, lessons, and rules of thumb they are discovering are revealing an entirely new field&#x2014;a set of generalizable insights for building social, economic, technical, and business systems that anticipate disruption, heal themselves when breached, and have the ability to reorganize themselves to maintain their core purpose, even under radically changed circumstances.<br> <br>With this in mind, consider how the Mexicans might have been spared their difficulties. Larger stockpiled reserves of corn, more diversified food crops, better real-time data, and better modeling of the impacts of U.S. corn crop diversion might obviously have helped; so too might a mechanism to rapidly secure alternative suppliers in a crisis, or restructuring the market to dampen the monopolies&#x2019; power, or investments in social programs for the poor to mitigate the effects of the price spike. Or one might just as readily have intervened in another point in the causal chain&#x2014;say, by diversifying U.S. energy production&#x2014;so that even a major hurricane wouldn&#x2019;t spur the diversion of corn to ethanol production in the first place.<br> <br>The strategies implied in each of these interventions&#x2014;ensuring that there are sufficient reserves available to any given system; or diversifying its inputs; or collecting better, real-time data about its operations and performance; or enabling greater autonomy for its constituent parts; or designing firebreaks so that a disturbance in one part does not disrupt the whole&#x2014;are, at their core, strategies of resilience. As we&#x2019;ll see, they can be applied at any scale, from whole civilizations to communities and organizations, to the lives of individual people.<br> <br>Defining resilience more precisely is complicated by the fact that different fields use the term to mean slightly different things. In engineering, resilience generally refers to the degree to which a structure like a bridge or a building can return to a baseline state after being disturbed. In emergency response, it suggests the speed with which critical systems can be restored after an earthquake or a flood. In ecology, it connotes an ecosystem&#x2019;s ability to keep from being irrevocably degraded. In psychology, it signifies the capacity of an individual to deal effectively with trauma. In business it&#x2019;s often used to mean putting in place backups (of data and resources) to ensure continuous operation in the face of natural or man-made disaster. Though different in emphasis, each of these definitions rests on one of two essential aspects of resilience: continuity and recovery in the face of change.<br> <br>Throughout this book, we will explore resilience in both systems and people. Accordingly, we frame resilience in terms borrowed from both ecology and sociology as the capacity of a system, enterprise, or a person to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of dramatically changed circumstances.<br> <br>To see what we mean, let&#x2019;s explore a metaphor used widely in resilience research. Imagine for a moment you are overlooking a vast landscape of imaginary hills and valleys, stretching out in every direction. Like something from a Borges fantasy, each valley in this panorama presents a significant variation on your present circumstance, an alternative reality with its own unique characteristics, opportunities, resources, and dangers. Each hill in this landscape can be thought of as the critical threshold or boundary separating these worlds&#x2014;once you pass its peak, you will, for good or ill, inexorably roll into the adjacent existential valley below. In some of these new circumstances, you may find life quite easy; in others, you may find things challenging; and in a few you may find your new reality so difficult that adaptation is all but impossible.<br> <br>As in real life, any number of sudden and serious disruptions might cause you to be &#x201c;flipped&#x201d; over the threshold separating your present context and a new one: Perhaps you experience a flood, or a drought, an invasion, or an earthquake, or perhaps your valley becomes too sparsely populated or too crowded to occupy. Perhaps your business encounters an economic or energy shock, a technological or competitive shift, a sudden shortage of raw materials, or the pricing in of environmental factors that were previously unaccounted for. Unfortunately, many of these thresholds may be crossed only in one direction: Once forces have compelled you into a new circumstance, it may be impossible for you to return to your prior environment. You&#x2019;ll have entered a new normal.<br> <br>To improve your resilience is to enhance your ability to resist being pushed from your preferred valley, while expanding the range of alternatives that you can embrace if you need to. This is what resilience researchers call preserving adaptive capacity&#x2014;the ability to adapt to changed circumstances while fulfilling one&#x2019;s core purpose&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s an essential skill in an age of unforeseeable disruption and volatility.<br> <br>There are, of course, many ways to expand your range of habitable niches. You could reduce your material needs in order to subsist in more resource-poor settings; you could learn to use a wider array of resources, so you could survive, MacGyver-like, on whatever might be locally available; you could invent a new technology, liberating yourself from a traditional constraint; you could modify tools designed for one niche to suit another; or you could learn to collaborate with the local denizens so that you don&#x2019;t have to go it alone.<br> <br>As it is for people, so it is for systems, businesses, nations, and even the planet as a whole&#x2014;all can occupy a number of different, stable states, some vastly preferable to others. Planetary boundaries (so named by the resilience researcher Johan Rockstr�m and his colleagues at the Stockholm Resilience Centre) are thresholds that keep the entire biosphere from flipping, suddenly and potentially catastrophically, into a new state: They include factors like the acidification of the oceans, the loss of biodiversity, human transformation of the land, and the availability of clean water. Of the nine thresholds Rockstr�m&#x2019;s team has identified, three are currently exceeded; another four are approaching their limit. Like Russian nesting dolls, these planetary boundaries set the limits and context for all human activities, from sett...</p><h2>Japan: A Modern History</h2><p>A definitive and compelling history of Japan details the tumultuous political, economic, and social change, over four centures, that molded Japan into a modern world power by bringing to life the many historical figures who helped build a successful and strong nation.</p><p><b>James L. McClain</b> is professor of history at Brown University. He is the author of three other books on Japanese history.McClain takes a multifaceted, nuanced look at Japan's last four centuries. A professor of history at Brown University, McClain begins with the investiture of Tokugawa Ieyasu as shogun in 1603, then leads the reader from daimyo castles of the 17th and 18th centuries to the filthy barracks of mine workers in the 19th century, to the refined, "cultured houses" of the emerging urban middle class in the 20th century. Equally adept at describing religious and intellectual currents, economic development, political maneuverings and the special problems faced by women and marginalized groups like Koreans and the Ainu, McClain draws on the most current studies of Japanese history. Throughout, he is evenhanded in his choice of subject matter and source. He acknowledges the contributions of the industrial giants, but gives voice to the rural poor, factory workers and victims of industrial pollution. He describes the geopolitical realities that drove Japan to empire but also unflinchingly details the horrors of war. More than a mere description of how Japan became a leading nation of the 20th century, this is a story with room for the pronouncements of emperors, the poetry of Basho and the demands of labor leaders. A newcomer to the subject may be daunted at first by the sheer volume of information, but McClain soon puts the reader at ease with his mastery of the subject and his clear, precise prose. Some readers may wonder at his decision to overlook events such as the Ako incident in the chapters on the Tokugawa era or Aum Shinrikyo's gassing of the Tokyo subway in his discussion of contemporary Japan, but overall this is a remarkable achievement. 70 illus. not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Seventh Dragon: The Riddle of Equal Temperament</h2><p>A veteran piano tuner presents a non-technical, literary view of the quixotic tuning system used on keyboard instruments for hundreds of years. Winner of the Western States Book Award for creative non-fiction in 1986, newly updated with illustrations, index, bibliography.</p><p>When Anita Sullivan started a second career as a piano tuner decades ago, she was immediately puzzled by the piano&#x2019;s complicated tuning system. Surprised to learn that her new profession was not only technically complex, but in fact required artistic judgments, she set herself to describing the tuning system in a way that would make sense to ordinary listeners, rather than piano technicians alone. This exceptional book is the result. Sullivan lives in Oregon, where recently she has turned her attention to early pianos, the tuning of historical temperaments, and the music that goes with them. Please visit http://www.seventhdragon.com for more information.The riddle of the Seventh Dragon injapanese folklore is that he is the only one who is never visible. His task is listening, and as Sullivan states in The Seventh Dragon: The Riddle of Equal Temperament, "Perhaps he never shows up because his visible self is constantly consumed in the act of hearing." Perhaps so, but Sullivan's own intellect and questioning perspective is plainly visible in this wonderful book-a book which may have begun as an investigation into the history and science of piano tuning but which grew into a philosophical probing of ratio, harmony, paradox, balance, wisdom, and beauty. As with most good pieces of writing, there are many levels of meaning in Sullivan's slim volume. One level reflects the precise and exacting maneuvers of the piano tuner at work, attempting to bring the instrument to a state of "equal temperament," the tuning system we have employed in the Western world for the last 150 years. While other tuning systems have been used, all are ultimately based on the relationships of beats. "These 'beats' are a way of measuring the degree of purity or harmony ... When all the intervals in the center are properly balanced, [the piano tuner] then tunes by octaves, outwards towards the bass and treble extremes of the keyboard. The result is not perfect symmetry, nor a collection of pure intervals, it is a balance- a compromise." A second level appears in the short but poetic "Tuner's Monologue" which introduces most of the chapters in this book. As the tuner attempts to achieve an equal temperament on the piano, her inner ear and eye respond to the struggle. "We must come to an understanding, this piano and L. . A test all the possibilities, and settle on the one which is in the piano's heart."Sullivan manages to turn piano tuning into a mystical search for balance without losing a certain pragmatism which enriches yet restrains the piece itself. "As you tune your unison, and you hear the beats gradually slowing down, there comes a place where they are too slow to count any more.. . . You are listening in a different way than ever before. You have stopped counting. You have stopped hearing with just your cars. You have stopped.. . . And I think the piano's song is right there, in the failing-in place, which is the final tempering." With critical questions and splendid, rich metaphors, Anita Sullivan has succeeded in constructing a rare combination of philosophy and literature. Winner of the 1986 Western States Book Award for Creative Nonfiction, The Seventh Dragon challenges the reader to re-vision many assumptions we often take for granted, and as humans, we are nourished by the process. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Die for Me</h2><p>In the City of Lights, two star-crossed lovers battle a fate that is destined to tear them apart again and again for eternity.<br> <br>When Kate Mercier's parents die in a tragic car accident, she leaves her life--and memories--behind to live with her grandparents in Paris.

Neither of them could guess their lives are about to implode. <br>Paul begins an affair with his young assistant, soon realizes he has made the fatal mistake of falling in love with her, then is threatened with exposure by Doug Anderton, a journalist who happens to be one of his oldest schoolboy enemies. At the same time, Benjamin and his friend Claire, still haunted by memories almost thirty years old, make a desperate attempt to break free of the past, if only to escape the notion that their happiest years are behind them. <br>As Cool Britannia is forced to address its ongoing racial and social tensions--and as its role in America's "war on terrorism" grows increasingly compromised--"The Closed Circle shuttles between London and Birmingham, where fat cats, politicos, media advisers, and protesters in both locales lay bare an era when policy and PR have become indistinguishable.

After gaining admission to Oxford, and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs and then marriage and family, Rebecca Mead reread <i>Middlemarch</i>. The novel, which Virginia Woolf famously described as "one of the few English novels written for grown-up people," offered Mead something that modern life and literature did not. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this wise and revealing work of biography, reporting, and memoir, Rebecca Mead leads the reader into the life that her favorite book made for her, as well as the many lives the novel has led since it was written. Employing a structure that perfectly mirrors that of the novel, <i>My Life in Middlemarch</i> takes the themes of Eliot's novel and brings them into the world. Offering both a fascinating reading of Eliot's biography and an uncanny portrait of the ways in which Mead's life echoes that of the author herself, <i>My Life in Middlemarch</i> is a book for who wonders about the power of literature to shape our lives.</p></p><p><p><b></b></p> <b>Rebecca Mead on writing My Life in Middlemarch</b> <p></p> <p>I first read Middlemarch, which many critics consider the greatest novel in the English language, when I was seventeen. The novel tells the interweaving stories of several residents of a provincial town in the Midlands; but to describe it this way is a bit like describing Everest as a really tall, ice-covered mountain. In its psychological acuity and generosity of spirit, in the deftness of its humor and immensity of its intelligence, Middlemarch offers everything we go to books for. It&#x2019;s awesome, in every sense of the word.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>I&#x2019;ve gone back to it every five years or so since, and every time I see something new. When I was an anxious, aspiring teenager, it seemed to be all about the anxieties and aspirations of youth. In my twenties, stumbling through misbegotten love affairs, it seemed to be about the meaning of love and marriage. In my thirties, establishing my career as a writer, the novel seemed to offer cautionary insight into how one might or might not achieve one&#x2019;s ambitions. By the time I was forty, conscious of the doors of youth closing behind me, the book seemed to offer a melancholy insight into the resignations of middle age.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>So revisiting Middlemarch by writing a book about it was also way of reckoning with the life I had lived so far: of looking at the choices I had made, the paths I had taken, and considering the alternative lives I had left unlived. For it, I read the diaries and letters of George Eliot, the book&#x2019;s author, who was born Mary Ann Evans in 1819; I visited the places she had lived, and I read about the lives of people who had been close to her. Having started out as the humble daughter of a provincial land agent, Eliot transformed herself into one of the dominant intellectual forces of her era&#x2014;first as an editor and critic for the most important London periodicals, and only later as a novelist. &#x201c;One has to spend so many years in learning how to be happy,&#x201d; she wrote to a friend when she was just twenty-four. She did find happiness: in love found late, and in a vocation discovered in maturity. &#x201c;I feel very full of thankfulness for all the creatures I have got to love, all the beautiful and great things that are given to me to know, and I feel, too, much younger and more hopeful, as if a great deal of life and work were still before me,&#x201d; Eliot wrote in 1861, when she was forty-one. Her greatest work was still before her: Middlemarch was ten years in the future.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>I hope that I have written a book that can be read by people who haven&#x2019;t read Middlemarch&#x2014;though I also hope that my book will make those readers want to discover George Eliot&#x2019;s masterpiece for themselves. I wanted to write a book that would speak to any passionate reader. Often, reading is thought of as escapism: we talk of &#x201c;getting lost&#x201d; in a book. But a book can also be where one finds oneself; and as I wrote My Life in Middlemarch I found that the novel spoke to me differently than it had during any of my earlier readings. Going back to Middlemarch gave me the chance to look at where I was in my life, and to ask myself how I had got there&#x2014;and to think, with a renewed sense of hopefulness, about where I might go next.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p>Rebecca Mead was born in London and educated at Oxford and New York University.

After several books that have had moderate success, Gerritsen has now written a gruesome and frightening story that should put her among the top women thriller writers working today.<p> A serial killer is on the loose in Boston. The victims are killed in a particularly nasty way: cut with a scalpel on the stomach, the intestines and uterus removed, and then the throat slashed. The killer obviously has medical knowledge and has been dubbed "the Surgeon" by the media. Detective Thomas Moore and his partner Rizzoli of the Boston Homicide Unit have discovered something that makes this case even more chilling. Years ago in Savannah a serial killer murdered in exactly the same way. He was finally stopped by his last victim, who shot him as he tried to cut her. That last victim is Dr. Catherine Cordell, who now works as a cardiac surgeon at one of Boston's prestigious hospitals. As the murders continue, it becomes obvious that the killer is drawing closer and closer to Dr. Cordell, who is becoming so frightened that she is virtually unable to function. But she is the only person who can help the police catch this copycat killer. Or is it a copycat? To complicate matters even further, Detective Moore, often referred to as Saint Thomas as he continues to mourn the loss of his wife, is getting emotionally involved with the doctor.</p><p> The suspense in <i>The Surgeon</i> is almost unbearable.

American journalist Brian Hall spent the spring and summer of 1991 traveling through Yugoslavia, even as the nation was crumbling in his footsteps. Having arrived a week after the catalytic May 2 massacre at Borovo Selo, he watched a political solutions were abandoned with dizzying speed, and as Yugoslavia s various ethnicities, which had managed to reach a point of tolerant coexistence, tipped into the violence of civil war.</p><p>Brian Hall is the author of three novels, including <b>I Should Be Extremely Happy in Your Company</b>, his acclaimed story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, as well as three works of nonfiction.An incisive and affecting Yugoslavian travelogue from May to mid-September 1991, just as the country split up and its former republics went to war. Hall (Stealing from a Deep Place, 1988, etc.) professes no solutions for the current Balkan trauma. Rather, he offers an elegy of sorts for the promise of humanism and an eyewitness account of the balkanization of mind and action. ``Even intellectuals in Yugoslavia tend to think the truth is not only knowable, but obvious,'' Hall writes, and he unravels that in lively scenes and portraits, mostly of ordinary people but also of Serbian president Slobodan Miloevi and the wearied Bosnian leader, Alija Izetbegovi. He describes the weirdness of Sarajevo television news, the slant of the stories dependent on the reporter's ethnicity. He traces the tortured rationalizations behind Croatians' defense of their not-so-unique language. He suggests that supportive audience members give a Serbian opposition press conference the feel of a revival meeting. Hall has a good grasp of the ironies of history (the Serbs claim the legacy of both the partisans and the Chetniks, who opposed each other in WW II) and of the present (Croatia's leading antidemocrats aren't home-grown- -they're &#x201a;migr&#x201a;s from Australia and Canada). In multiethnic Bosnia, the microcosm of Yugoslavia, he drinks local-style coffee with Sarajevans yearning for reconciliation, their cosmopolitan ``private dream'' not shared by those in the divided countryside. In Kosovo, Hall finds a bearded Albanian passing as a Serb and maintaining an eight-year secret relationship with his girlfriend from home. Only in Kosovo, Hall observes, do old rural traditions remain intact despite the ``self-vaunting'' talk about Croat, Serb, or Muslim culture. Understandably incomplete as a tale of recent history, but a worthy aid to understanding Yugoslavia's demise. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Together they embarked on a lifelong pursuit of rare plants, first in Europe and then in the United States, where they migrated in the late 1930s. Every spring they explored the American Southwest in a sputtering Dodge, discovering new species and cultivating the spoils at their renowned home gardens. Barneby published so many taxonomic findings that he became a world authority on legumes. But the two men had other interests as well: they were intimates in the expatriate circles that included W. H. Auden and Peggy Guggenheim, and early collectors of painters such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mir�. Ripley, a prescient artist himself, whose startling work in colored pencil was lost in a trunk for several decades before being rediscovered, used his fortune to bankroll much of the avant-garde art scene of the early 1950s. <br><br>The lives of Ripley and Barneby were shaped by a passion for knowing the world in all its lush particulars. Douglas Crase, who received an education in character when he came to know Barneby in the 1970s, offers us not just the brilliantly told story of &#x201c;both,&#x201d; but a vivid portrait of the bohemian postwar period they inhabited, bristling with the energy of the new.</p><p>Douglas Crase was born in 1944 in Battle Creek, Michigan, and grew up on a nearby farm.

A former MacArthur Fellow, he lives in New York City and Honesdale, Pennsylvania.Chapter 1<br><br>Although Dr. Rupert C. Barneby was apparently the most accomplished legume taxonomist since Bentham, and had prepared himself since childhood to that end, his work was a subject that I as a nonscientist could not readily discuss. This did not disappoint him. It was enough in 1975 that I came along as the partner of his new friend, Frank Polach. Frank and I had arrived in New York the year before, when we both were thirty, and Frank had begun work soon after as a plant information officer at the New York Botanical Garden. There, bearing an unrecognizable leaf sent by some anxious gardener, he approached the celebrated elder figure who was known, instantly and by everyone, it seems, as Rupert. The leaf was identified, and now Frank and I were on our way to the Botanical Garden where we had been invited to Rupert's for dinner so that I too might be presented for inspection. A visiting botanist will reach the garden today, I suppose, by cab from the airport or by car from the suburbs. I wonder how to convey the impact, on a provincial newcomer, of this dinner excursion that began, by contrast, with descent to the IND local at Twenty-third Street, change to the D train, and exit fifty minutes later to street-level air on Bedford Park Boulevard in the unfamiliar Bronx. Down the hill and across the railroad tracks stood the Mosholu Gate to the Botanical Garden beyond. Frank had told me that the garden once was part of the Lorillard estate; never, despite his description, could I have foreseen the freedom of ground and sky, the splendid if threatened optimism of the Museum Building, the acres of primeval hemlock (the woolly adelgid had not begun its destruction), or the precipitous river gorge we had to cross in order to arrive at the side door of Pierre Lorillard's old stone stable, its ground floor occupied by the garden security headquarters, its loft by Rupert Barneby. Here, at the head of the narrow stairs, we were welcomed to a room that fit beneath its pitched roof like the nave of a small Gothic chapel, stone walls exposed, deep casement windows encrusted with grime. On the floors were antique Bijar rugs, on the walls an oil by Mir�, two drawings by Jackson Pollock, foxed prints of Astragalus (the legume genus, aSTRAGGalus, as we were later to learn, that was Rupert's lifelong taxonomic passion), and, lined up wherever there was an available shelf or ledge, the books that included rare floras, first-edition poetry, travel guides in French, German, Spanish, Portuguese. It was hard to believe, while seated at a refectory table on eighteenth-century Portuguese chairs, when served a gentle curry on hand-painted Spode, or while smoking after dinner the smuggled cigars, that we were destined ever to get back on the subway. Instead we soaked up the gossip, delivered in an English accent that was both unassuming and lyrically at odds with the occasional squawk from the two-way radio downstairs: firsthand gossip about Auden and Isherwood, Peggy Guggenheim and Marcel Duchamp (figures as otherwise legendary to me as Bentham and Hooker, George Forrest, or Redout� may be to botanists), and gossip, too, about a figure whose name we did not recognize but whose portrait, in the lightly Surrealist manner of a vanished era, hung in the bedroom-our host's own partner of forty-eight years, the late Dwight Ripley.<br><br>My reaction to that evening was not original: greedy to learn and at the same time bristling with pride so as not to be influenced. The aesthetics of Surrealism, the habits of a discipline so foreign as taxonomy, had little, I thought, to offer me. Besides, like every other potential mentor, the sixty-three-year-old Rupert Barneby was inconsistent. He warned us, perhaps that very evening, against making "a deep plan" for our lives; if you have a deep plan, he said, you set yourselves up for disaster. It was advice that seemed congruent with his personality. Years later we discovered a description of Rupert in the diaries of Judith Malina, actress and founder of the avant-garde Living Theatre, who knew him in his forties. "Rupert, the gentle one," she wrote, "submits to fate, seems to be part of an eternal process, like the bud, blossom and withering of one of his plants." And yet this gentle one, at the very moment he was warning us to avoid deep plans, was himself finishing work on "Daleae Imagines," the illustrated revision of the genus Dalea that had occupied him then for at least ten years. Was this no plan? At a memorial tribute that would be held at the garden in 2001, after Rupert died, we heard Gwilym Lewis, from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, emphasize that Rupert's published output could be calculated at one new page of taxonomic text every third day for fifty-nine consecutive years. Perhaps the deepest plan of all had been the one that inspired his "Atlas of North American Astragalus," published in 1964 and still the standard in its field, an achievement that was not ten but twenty years in the making, had a long foreground before that, and continued to claim his interest thereafter. Clearly Rupert did have lessons to teach, though he did so by such unexpected example that what I chiefly value from our early years with him is surprise: surprise when this thoroughly achieved figure insisted on being as alive in the present as we were, when he reached across time, nationality, and (let's face it) social class to provide a sudden moral poke. How could I forget the day I was feeling so justly sorry for myself, and he asked what was wrong? Oh nothing, I said, just my life is over. And Rupert's response, so swift it nearly felled me, was, "How dare you say that to me!"<br><br>Only later did I fully grasp that Frank and I had come to dinner not two years after Rupert's own partner, he of the portrait, had died. The story of their partnered lives, the way those lives blended productively into the worlds of botany and art, cannot truly be told without a look back to their beginnings. Rupert had been born at Trewyn (he pronounced it treWIN), a brooding pile of a country house built in the late seventeenth century on still more ancient foundations at the foot of the Black Mountains, just barely across the border from England, in Wales. It was here in the uplands, along Offa's Dyke, around the ruins of Llanthony Priory, that he discovered as a boy his affinity for the forms and identities of plants. Frank and I were to see this special area one rainy October 6 after pitching and sliding our rental car up a lane so deep we could not see where we were until, cresting the hill, we came perilously close to the back door of Trewyn itself. This was not a polite arrival. Certainly it astonished the owner, the Lady Telford, who in her yellow slicker climbed down from the bulldozer she had rented for the day and offered to show us inside; she could scarcely believe that word of the bed-and-breakfast she intended to open had reached so soon across the Atlantic. Shamelessly I exploited the misunderstanding, and a few minutes later we were standing in the upstairs room (it's behind the second-floor front window at far left) where Rupert Charles Barneby was born. Rupert too was astonished when he learned of our visit. We had been there, uncannily, on his birthday. Whether he was delighted or appalled by our effrontery I couldn't tell, but he studied raptly the brochure we brought him: Trewyn Court, Bed &amp; Breakfast. "It was never a court!" he said indignantly. In 1911, the year he was born, Trewyn comprised several thousand acres; he remembered riding with his mother in a carriage at Christmas to deliver presents in the village. In New York he devised traditions of his own. Each year a Christmas poinsettia would appear, delivered personally by Rupert to the lobby of our building. He never announced himself on these occasions but went on his way, dispensing gifts, perhaps, to his other villagers.<br><br>The young Rupert did not live continuously at Trewyn. During World War I his mother, born Louisa Geraldine Ingham, was so fearful of being left alone in the country that his father, Philip Bartholomew Barneby, rented something even more substantial to house his family while he was away: Ludlow Castle. All of it. Rupert's earliest botanical memory, which will explain perhaps his fondness for yellow, was of a cowslip in the Ludlow Castle moat. Not far to the southeast stood Saltmarshe Castle, the crenellated and dramatic, not to say melodramatic residence in Herefordshire of his grandfather William Barneby. And east of that, near Bromyard, was the historic family seat of Lower Brockhampton, a crooked, half-timbered manor house built in the fourteenth century, preserved and now opened to visitors by the National Trust. Rupert had two older brothers, Edmund and Tom, and a younger sister, Geraldine. When he was nine, the fourteen-year-old Edmund was killed in a riding accident at Trewyn; his mother again grew fearful of the country, and the family retreated to Wilcroft, a second Georgian landmark they maintained near Hereford in the village of Bartestree. Budd Myers, a friend who knew Rupert during the 1960s, once heard that he was secretly a Plantagenet, in a direct though illegitimate line from Richard, Duke of York. Surely this was a tale for gullible Americans. So, being Americans, Frank and I looked in Burke's Landed Gentry, where the original Barneby is identified, suggestively, as among York's retinue and as treasurer in 1461 to York's legitimate son, Edward IV. We were not surprised to learn that Rupert had a family coat of arms. On the shield are lions, rampant, and below is the motto VIRTUTE NON VI.<br><br>Like his father before him, Rupert was sent to an exclusive, or, as the English call it, a "public" school. His father had attended Eton; Rupert followed his brother Tom to Harrow. Unlike father or brother, he soon was sent home again. At Harrow the fourteen-year-old Rupert Barneby had met the sixteen-year-old Dwight Ripley, and the result was a sudden boyhood romance. Ripley, whose full name was Harry Dwight Dillon Ripley, was an only child born...</p><h2>Roses are Red, Are Violets Blue??</h2><p>Rhymes and prose identify the basic colors and describe what happens when they are combined.</p><p></p><h2>Its Day Being Gone (Penguin Poets)</h2><p><b>Selected as a winner of the National Poetry Series by Robert Wrigley</b><br><br>Rose McLarney has won acclaim for image-rich poems that explore her native southern Appalachia and those who love and live and lose on it. Her second collection broadens these investigations in poems that examine the shape-shifting quality of memory, as seen in folktales that have traveled across oceans and through centuries, and in how we form recollections of our own lives. An opening sequence presents contemporary ghost stories: men who gather at dawn in the gas station parking lots of small towns; the mountain lion that paces the edge of a receding tree line. A middle section draws connections between Appalachia and Latin America, places that share qualities of biological and cultural richness&#x2014;places that are threatened by modernization. A final sequence retells the stories of earlier poems, posing questions about how we construct our landscapes and frame our views.</p><p><b>Rose McLarney</b> is the author of <i>The Always Broken Plates of Mountains.</i> Her poems have appeared in the<i> Kenyon Review, Orion, Slate</i>, and the <i>New England Review</i>.

He embarks on two concurrent professions: one as a major investor in a small pharmaceutical company, and the other as the head of a black market drug-smuggling and -distribution operation. Charles has to sort through the legal and illegal, moral and immoral, and right and wrong as he navigates the War on Drugs and the crony pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p>Meet Tristana Dubocher&#x2014;CEO of Charles&#x2019;s company (Visioryme Pharmaceuticals)&#x2014;and her sniveling husband, Donald, an FDA minion.

Their careers in the drug world are forever altered when they meet Charles.</p> <p>Most importantly, meet <i>Naked Emperor</i>, a street drug that doesn&#x2019;t cloud minds, but clears them. Naked Emperor prevents people from being able to lie to themselves. Anyone dependent on deception knows that this new drug will turn the world against them. Mobs of politicians, environmentalists, academics, tele-evangelists, jihadists, journalists, central bankers, Deep State actors, and crony parasites join forces to wipe Naked Emperor off the face of the planet.</p> <p>They all want him dead. But Charles Knight intends to start a revolution.</p></p><p>Doug Casey spends most of his time in Argentina and Uruguay, with frequent visits to the U.S., Canada, and various dysfunctional hellholes. John Hunt, MD, is a pediatrician, pulmonologist, allergist, immunologist, and former academic who resigned his tenure at a major university and stopped practicing because the insane had taken over the asylum. Now he keeps himself occupied trying to slay Leviathan.<p>"<em>Drug Lord</em> should come with a warning sticker: CAUTION, THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE." <strong>-- Paul Rosenberg, author of <em>The Breaking Dawn</em> and <em>Free-Man's Perspective</em></strong><br><br>"Hunt and Casey do a great job describing in creative story telling what happens behind the scenes in the pharmaceutical industry while critiquing the drug war. Head to head comparisons of big pharma to black markets, and of FDA to the DEA, illustrate what every American should know."<strong>-- Ralph Weber, CEO, MediBid Inc., author of <em>Rigged: How Insurance Ruined Healthcare</em></strong><br><br>"Ayn Rand's <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> was the novel that sparked a free market revolution in the 20th century. <em>Drug Lord</em> could be the novel that ignites that spark into an inferno in the 21st century. And I can't think of a better person to pen it with than Doug Casey."<strong>-- Jeff Berwick, <em>The Dollar Vigilante</em></strong><br><br>"In <em>Speculator</em>, we met Charles Knight who balanced contempt for bureaucracy with personal ambition. His next adventure takes him into the heart of the two-headed beast: drug wars and the pharmaceutical business. As a physician entrepreneur I loved this book, and cannot wait for the next installment!"<strong>-- Jonathan M. Sackier, MB, ChB, FRCS, FACS, Hon DSc, Visiting Professor of Surgery, Oxford University</strong><br><br>"<em>Drug Lord</em> is as equally entertaining as it is edifying. I read it over the course of three days and was totally absorbed. Knight's adventures were much more fun than my usual day-to-day, to say the least."<strong>-- Ross Ulbricht </strong><br><br>"Karl Marx was right that economics determines history. But he didn't realize governments could distort economies so badly that only the intrepid might survive. And only after they reaped generous rewards could the 'meek (proletariat) inherit the earth.' <em>Drug Lord</em>'s intrepid hero, Charles Knight, is the representation of this ultimate reality. Engaging and enlightening". <strong><em>-- </em>Barry Reid, author of <em>The Paper Trip</em></strong><br><br>"Charles Knight hits his stride, stepping on from his smashing role in Speculator, to gather steam in <em>Drug Lord</em>. <em>Speculator</em> was great and successful, but <em>Drug Lord</em> is possibly better: it's different; it's smoother, and Charles Knight is smarter now. The dialogue and settings teach life lessons." <strong>-- Bo Keeley, executive hobo, racquetball champion, global vagabond, and prolific author</strong><br><br>"Charles Knight is back--a little older, a little wiser, and trying to get a whole lot richer. This time he's learning how to sell legal drugs at an illegal discount through an even less legal market. Casey and Hunt manage to entertain and inform at the same time, revealing the often fatal, though unintended, consequences of regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the IRS, and a cornucopia of bureaucracies. <em>Drug Lord </em>is another stylishly written paean to free markets and free minds." <strong>-- Jo Ann Skousen, Professor, Chapman University</strong><br><br>"Through a cleverly crafted plot, Hunt and Casey sound the alarm on paternalistic laws, over-legislation, and the growing police state. The story reads like historical nonfiction as government officials morally justify evil acts for a perceived greater good, letting the reader ponder serious philosophical issues while enjoying a thoroughly good yarn."<strong>-- Jeffrey James Higgins, retired DEA supervisory special agent</strong><br>"<em>Drug Lord</em> is <em>Chicken Soup for the Ancap Soul</em>."<strong>-- Albert Lu, CEO, Sprott US Media and host of <em>The Power &amp; Market Report</em></strong><br><br>"<em>Drug Lord</em>--it's Ayn Rand with guns and drugs! But that doesn't do John Hunt and Doug Casey justice. They've written a thriller that's whatever the opposite of 'escapism' is. Call it 'right-here-and-right-now-ism.' It's an adventure in rationalism with a heartening lesson. Reason is not only the source of liberty, it's the source of virtue." <strong>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Editor, <em>American Consequences</em> magazine and author of <em>How the Hell Did This </em>Happen? The Presidential Campaign of 2016</strong><br> <br><em> "Drug Lord"</em> is a fantastic follow up in the High Ground Novel Series, one that will keep you glued to your seat as you follow Knight in his journey.

Though his works like Skylands and Longwood Gardens are well known, his name has been eclipsed by his contemporary, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. Yet Vitale&#39;s influence on the modern direction of landscape design and his promotion of it as a profession is arguably more significant than Olmsted&#39;s. His unique designs and philosophy, which challenged the then-dominant pictorial mode of landscape architecture, influenced generations of followers, and is still felt today. Vitale (1875-1933) developed his rationale designs, based on the principles of composition from the fine arts and architecture, in both civic commissions and, most notably, at the country estates of captains of industry and finance. He introduced an idealized and abstracted type of formal design that created beautiful spaces, structured large sites, and reflected informal and relaxed plant compositions. Ferruccio Vitale tours over 40 of his masterworks, photographed by some of the best landscape photographers of the time, including Samuel Gottscho. It recounts the compelling story of a life in the early twentieth century, influenced by immigrant dreams, social clubs, and professional connections, and its culmination in some of the greatest landscapes of the 20th century.</p><p>Terry R.

Embracing the cooking of the entire Diaspora, the book not only offers familiar, Eastern-European-derived treats like roast chicken, brisket, kugels, and the slow-cooking stews called <i>cholents</i>, but also "new" Shabbat dishes like Duck with Pomegranate and Walnut Sauce from Iran, Lamb Tagine from Morocco, Cauliflower Pie from Italy, and Halibut in Lemon-Egg Sauce from the eastern Mediterranean, among other easily made entr�es. Challah recipes are included, as are recipes for pareve desserts--simple but delicious sweets like Apple-Honey Brown Betty, Banana Sorbet, and a truly seductive chocolate mousse.

Law </i>and a Nebula Award for his story &#x201c;MaQui.&#x201d; He lives in Sherman Oaks, California.One <br>When I was a young child growing up in Korea, it was said that the image of the fading moon at daybreak, re�flected in a pond or stream or even a well, resembled the speckled shell of a dragon&#x2019;s egg. A dragon embodied the yang, the mascu�line principle of life, and it was thought that if a couple expecting a child prayed to the dragon&#x2019;s egg, their offspring would be male. Of course, every family in those days desired a son over a daughter. Only men could carry on the family line; women&nbsp; were merely ves�sels by which to provide society with an uninterrupted supply of men. So every day for months before I was born, my parents would rise before dawn, carrying offerings of fresh-steamed rice cakes to the stone well behind our home, as the sky brightened and snuff ed out the stars. And they would pray to the pale freckled face of the moon floating on the water&#x2019;s surface, pray that the child growing inside my mother&#x2019;s womb would be a boy. <br>In this they were to be disappointed. On the third day of the First Moon in the Year of the Rooster, their first and only daughter was born to them. In those waning days of the Yi Dynasty, new�born girls&nbsp; were not deemed important enough to be graced with formal names, but&nbsp; were instead given nicknames. Often these repre�sented some personal characteristic: Cheerful, Pretty, Little One, Big One. Sometimes they presumed to be commandments: Chastity, or Virtue. A few&#x2014;Golden Calf, Little Flower&#x2014; verged on the po�etic. But too many names reflected the parents&#x2019; feelings about the birth of a daughter. I knew a girl named Anger, and another called Pity. More than a few&nbsp; were known as Sorrow or Sadness. And ev�eryone had heard the story of the father who named his firstborn daughter &#x201c;One is Okay,&#x201d; his next, &#x201c;Perhaps After the Second,&#x201d; the third, &#x201c;Three Laughs,&#x201d; and the last, &#x201c;Four Shames.&#x201d; <br>As for me, my parents named me &#x201c;Regrettable&#x201d;&#x2014;eventually shortened to simply Regret. <br>Koreans seldom address one another by their given names; we believe a person&#x2019;s name is a thing of intimacy and power, not to be used casually by anyone but a family member or close friend. When I was very young, Regret was merely a name to me, signi�fying nothing more than that. But as I grew older and learned it held another meaning, it became a stone weight in my heart. A call to supper became a reminder of my unfortunate presence at the dinner table. A stern rebuke by my father&#x2014;&#x201c;Regret, what are we to do with you?&#x201d;&#x2014;seemed to hint that my place in the family was impermanent. Too young to understand the real reasons, I won�dered what was wrong with me to make me so unwanted. Was I too short? I&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t as tall as my friend Sunny, but not nearly so short as her sister Lotus. Was I too plain? I spent hours squinting into the mirror, judging my every feature, and found them want�ing. My eyes&nbsp; were set too close together, my nose was too small, or maybe it was too big; my lips&nbsp; were thin, my ears flat. It was clear to see, I was plain and unlovely&#x2014;no wonder my parents regretted my birth. <br>In truth, my father was merely old-fashioned and conservative, a strict adherent to Confucian ideals, one of which was the inher�ent pre ce dence of man over woman: &#x201c;The wife must regard her husband as heavenly; what he does is a heavenly act and she can only follow him.&#x201d; I was a girl, I would eventually marry and be�come part of someone&nbsp; else&#x2019;s family; as such my existence was sim�ply not of the same consequence as that of my three brothers, who would carry on the family line and provide for our parents when they became old. <br>But I knew none of this when I was young, and instead decided it was due to the shape of my nose or the color of my eyes; and for years to come I would fret over and find fault with the girl who looked back at me from the mirror. <br>I have traveled far from the land of my birth, and even farther from who I was then. More than forty years and four thousand miles separate us: the girl of sixteen who took that fi rst unwitting step forward, and the woman in her sixtieth year who now, in sight of the vast Pacific, presumes to memorialize this journey in mere words. It is a journey measured not in time or distance, but in the breadth of one&#x2019;s soul and the struggle of becoming. <br>Excerpted from Honolulu by Alan Brennert.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Alan Brennert.<br>Published in February 2010 by St. Martin's Press.<br>All rights reserved.

But here and there, a few stalwart individuals carry on the old traditions. Henri Vaillancourt of Greenville, New Hampshire is in large part responsible for the continuing survival of the birch bark canoe. McPhee tells the story not only of Vaillancourt and his work, but of the canoe&#39;s role in American history. Many McPhee fans consider this lovely and lucid book one of his finest works.<b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University.

Most of all, she's missed her career as a journalist, which was just getting started. In Chiang Mai, she was covering substantial stories and major crimes. But here in Maprao, Jimm has to scrape assignments from the local online journal, the Chumphon Gazette&#x2015;and be happy about it when she gets one. This time they are sending her out to interview a local <i>farang</i> (European) writer, a man in his late fifties, originally from England, who writes award-winning crime novels, one Conrad Coralbank. </p><p>At the same time, several local women have left town without a word to anyone, leaving their possessions behind. These include the local doctor, Dr. Sumlak, who never returned from a conference, and the Thai wife of that <i>farang</i> writer, the aforementioned Conrad Coralbank. All of which looks a little suspicious, especially to Jimm's grandfather, an ex-cop, who notices Coralbank's interest in Jimm with a very jaundiced eye. With a major storm headed their way and a potential serial killer on the loose, it looks like Jimm Juree, her eccentric family, and the whole town of Maprao is in for some major changes. </p><p><i>The Axe Factor</i> is a Jimm Juree mystery from Colin Cotterill.</p></p><p>Born in London, COLIN COTTERILL has worked as a teacher in Israel, Australia, the U.S., and Japan before he started training teachers in Thailand.

Merry Christmas to you and your family. It&#x2019;s been a while since I wrote. I hope you are well. My sister (aka brother) Sissi and I noticed that you recently fired your personal assistant, Liced. We hope it had nothing to do with us hacking into her e-mail account and accessing private information about Malpaso Productions. Liced was a victim in all this and was virtually blackmailed into helping us. I hope you can forgive her and consider rehiring her. As we now have nobody &#x201c;on the inside,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m sending this package to your private post office box. I promise this is the last confidential information we will take advantage of. The enclosed DVD contains recorded footage of our very exciting pursuit of Burmese slaves on the Gulf of Thailand. As a live Internet feed, we attracted 1.3 million viewers for the event. Sissi and I are certain every one of them would gladly fork out fifteen dollars a ticket and watch it as a cinematic experience, especially if Natalie Portman played me. But I bow to you on casting decisions on this one. I&#x2019;ve taken the liberty of wrapping the DVD in my screenplay adaptation of the events. <br>Clint, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll recall that this is the fourth screenplay I&#x2019;ve sent you, each one more thrilling than the last. Although I haven&#x2019;t heard back from you personally (not complaining. Old age is catching up with all of us), we did intercept a message from one of your editorial reviewers that referred to serious doubts about the quality of characterization in our second manuscript. First, it was heartening to know you bothered to have our work assessed internally. But we feel a need to address this issue, especially as the characters in the second screenplay are my family members. We considered the comments to be unfairly cruel and I would like to take your editor to task. <br>Our mother, Mair, is perhaps starting to feel the teeth of dementia nibbling at her heels, but that doesn&#x2019;t make her &#x201c;nutty as a fruitcake&#x201d; as your reviewer described her. She has long coherent periods which do not involve wearing odd shoes or buying secondhand Cosplay rabbit suits on eBay. (She&#x2019;s only done that once. She wanted to bond with the dogs.) Between you and me, she was a &#x201c;flower child&#x201d; for several years and did spend a good deal of time in the jungle with anti-system elements and there may have been intoxicants ingested at that time. But I&#x2019;d like to see them as turning her into a more whole and mellow human rather than &#x201c;a fruit basket.&#x201d; <br>The older gentleman who was described as &#x201c;unlikable and two-dimensional&#x201d; is, in fact, my Grandad Jah. I have to agree with the &#x201c;unlikable&#x201d; part, but Grandad, I have to strongly protest, is not lacking a dimension. At the very most, he may be short a sense or two. But his absence of humor and social etiquette is more than made up for by his innate skill as an investigator. One would imagine that forty years spent in the Thai Police Force, where the focus is on amassing great wealth rather than putting oneself in harm&#x2019;s way, might erase a man&#x2019;s policing instincts. But Grandad Jah has uncanny abilities and is as honest as the day is long (which explains why he&#x2019;s still penniless). <br>This brings me to my brother, Arnon, known affectionately as Arny, after his hero Arnold Schwarzenegger. Had we not followed our mother to the northernmost southern province in Thailand for reasons that I&#x2019;ve only recently come to understand, he would undoubtedly have been this year&#x2019;s Mr. Chiang Mai Body Beautiful. So, the comment, &#x201c;This character has no personality, no abilities and absolutely no purpose for being in the story,&#x201d; is a bit like complaining that Moby Dick didn&#x2019;t have much of a speaking part. Everything revolves around Arny. He&#x2019;s the sounding board for my stories, and even though he wouldn&#x2019;t harm a fly, he is my protector. In the last screenplay you&#x2019;ll notice that he takes on a boatload of pirates all by himself. I may have exaggerated the number of opponents he faced and the injuries he inflicted, but he did make a good account of himself in front of his fianc�e. <br>The &#x201c;Impossible Hermaphrodite Queen,&#x201d; is my &#x201c;sister,&#x201d; Sissi, who was neither born with conflicting organs nor crowned. If your reviewer had bothered to read the character sheet, he or she would know this. I feel he or she was just being smart in an attempt to impress you. I&#x2019;m sure you have a lot of people sucking up to you. Sissi is transgender and has a medical certificate to prove it. With reference to her computer skills, the Malpaso threat to &#x201c;chase you down and run you out of business,&#x201d; was very dramatic, but I&#x2019;m sure you realize she&#x2019;s un-chasable and un-runoutable. Our hacking has, you&#x2019;ll have to agree, been very friendly, and even though your accounts were wide open to access and abuse, we have not robbed you blind. And I&#x2019;m sure that when we&#x2019;re sitting down at the negotiating table discussing the finer details of our first movie deal, we&#x2019;ll all look back at these days and laugh. <br>Which brings me to me, Jimm Juree. I should perhaps have been the most offended and hurt by your reviewer&#x2019;s comments, but I am traditionally a punching bag for abuse. As I am only thirty four and have never been in domestic service, I was forced to look up some other meaning for &#x201c;old maid.&#x201d; Once found, I am obliged to protest most strongly. I was married and had conjugal moments with my husband during our three-point-seven years of marriage. At least once a month, if I remember rightly. Not a record, I agree, but enough to disqualify me from being &#x201c;a woman who has not formed a human pair bond by the time she is approaching or has reached menopause and the end of her reproductive lifespan.&#x201d; ( <i>Wikipedia.</i>) My husband had been desperate to appear married and I was desperate to be asked, which may not make us a pair bond, but it&#x2019;s a precedent. I have a good ten years of premenopausal hunting left in me. <br>I also take objection to the expression &#x201c;a very unlikely Thai female character.&#x201d; If by this he means I don&#x2019;t work in a rice paddy or a go-go bar, am not listed on any Internet dating sites, and do not walk with tiny steps or speak demurely when in male company, then, fair enough, he&#x2019;s got me. But, in fact, we Thai gals were given admittance to the twenty-first century. We&#x2019;re allowed to chat online and study overseas and speak foreign languages. Would you believe it? We can even run companies and stand for parliament. No, Clint, my hero, I don&#x2019;t believe for a second that you want movie scripts full of stereotypes, and I&#x2019;m sure you sent that confidential internal memo to the trash where it belonged. <br>Well, hey. You probably can&#x2019;t wait to get your teeth into the enclosed DVD and manuscript, so I&#x2019;ll stop here. As Sissi and I are sure the North American postal service is all but redundant since the advent of e-mails, we decided to increase the odds of you receiving this package by making thirty-seven copies, which we are sending to your work colleagues, some senior shareholders of the company, friends and family. In each one we have included a small plant pot mat hand-embroidered by Hmong hill-tribe women in the north. As I say, when we&#x2019;re all raking in the dollars from our first movie collaboration, you&#x2019;ll stop seeing this as harassment and appreciate the charming side of it. Somewhere on the director&#x2019;s voice-over on the DVD you&#x2019;ll mention how annoyed you were at first but that those goddamned crazy Thais had one hell of a product. <br>Have a great Christmas and may Santa bring you yet another Oscar. <br>Love, Jimm and Sissi <br>(Postal address withheld but you have our e-mail) <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Colin Cotterill <br></p><h2>The Melting Clock (A Toby Peters Mystery)</h2><p>Accompanied by a scholarly dwarf and a wrestler-turned-poet, 1942 Hollywood investigator Toby Peters investigates the disappearance of three of Salvador Dali&#39;s paintings from his Carmel, California, retreat</p><p>Written in a style similar to Dashiell Hammett&#39;s, this Toby Peters crime story is read with the panache and drama of the strong, silent type. Reminding one of Humphrey Bogart when he played Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep, Parker, with tongue firmly in cheek, reads Kaminsky&#39;s succinct descriptions of the quirky Salvador Dali and his entourage; listeners can almost hear him drag on a cigarette and see it dangling from his lip. Set in wartime L.A., the story draws Toby into a bizarre art world of mustaches without faces, crumbling stone women and melting watches. This one keeps listeners tuned in for the big finish. S.C.A. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineEdgar Award winner Kaminsky ( Poor Butterfly ) pairs his 1940s L.A. private investigator Toby Peters with surrealist painter Salvador Dali in the series hero's 16th outrageous escapade. Dali and his wife, Gala, hire Peters to find three paintings and three ornate Russian clocks stolen from their house in Carmel. The only clue is an enigmatic note that, once deciphered with the help of his friend Jeremy Butler, ex-wrestler and poet, leads Peters to a murdered man, one clock and a painting defaced with another coded message. Aided again by Jeremy, Peters discovers another dead man, another clock and another work of art, on which is scrawled the message "Time is running out. "Dali confesses planning the theft and the notes as a publicity stunt, but he is horrified by the murders. Peters fears that the painter will be the third victim and enlists the aid of Jeremy and another friend, Gunther, for protection. Once again Kaminsky mixes the real--in this case the surreal--with the fictional for a quick-paced, clever revisionist Hollywood romp. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sacred Chaos: Spiritual Disciplines for the Life You Have</h2><p>Life is often chaotic.

This sweeping historical narrative traces the spark of invention from the laboratories of nineteenth-century Europe to the massive industrial and scientific efforts of the Manhattan Project. Along the way, Fetter-Vorm takes special care to explain the fundamental science of nuclear reactions. With the clarity and accessibility that only a graphic book can provide, <i>Trinity </i>transports the reader into the core of a nuclear reaction&#x2015;into the splitting atoms themselves.</p><p>The power of the atom was harnessed in a top-secret government compound in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where some of the greatest scientific minds in the world gathered together to work on the bomb. Fetter-Vorm showcases J. Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, and General Leslie Groves, the fathers of the atomic bomb, whose insights unleashed the most devastating explosion known to humankind. These brilliant scientists wrestled daily with both the difficulty of building an atomic weapon and the moral implications of actually succeeding.</p><p>When the first bomb finally went off at a test site code-named Trinity, the world was irreversibly thrust into a new and terrifying age. With powerful renderings of the catastrophic events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Fetter-Vorm unflinchingly chronicles the far-reaching political, environmental, and ethical effects of this new discovery. Richly illustrated and deeply researched, <i>Trinity </i>is a dramatic, informative, and thought-provoking book on one of the most significant and harrowing events in history.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan Fetter-Vorm</b> is the illustrator of recent graphic adaptations of <i>Beowulf </i>and&nbsp;<i>Moby-Dick</i>.

Of course, a class trip is in her plan book. Those familiar with the inimitable school bus and its previous fantastical journeys are in for another treat; those who are not are in for a wild introduction. With her usual dash and aplomb, the teacher gathers her students, they board the bus, and off they go on an adventuresome trip to the ocean floor. All listen as she informs them about the geologic strata they pass, the flora and fauna at the various depths, the unique interdependence of the undersea world, and in turn, how its survival depends upon humankind's actions on land. The engaging characterizations and use of informative cartoon bubbles continue to be a hallmark of this exuberant author/illustrator team. The vibrant text is well researched and accurate; it is presented with such humor and lightness that everyone will wish for a seat on that magic bus.

Does nature abhor infinity? In startling and beautiful prose, Janna Levin's diary of unsent letters to her mother describes what we know about the shape and extent of the universe, about its beginning and its end. She grants the uninitiated access to the astounding findings of contemporary theoretical physics and makes tangible the contours of space and time--those very real curves along which apples fall and planets orbit.</p><br><p>Levin guides the reader through the observations and thought-experiments that have enabled physicists to begin charting the universe. She introduces the cosmic archaeology that makes sense of the pattern of hot spots left over from the big bang, a pursuit on the verge of discovering the shape of space itself. And she explains the topology and the geometry of the universe now coming into focus--a strange map of space full of black holes, chaotic flows, time warps, and invisible strings. Levin advances the controversial idea that this map is edgeless but finite--that the universe is huge but not unending--a radical revelation that would provide the ultimate twist to the Copernican revolution by locating our precise position in the cosmos.</p><br><p>As she recounts our increasingly rewarding attempt to know the universe, Levin tells her personal story as a scientist isolated by her growing knowledge. This book is her remarkable effort to reach across the distance of that knowledge and share what she knows with family and friends--and with us. Highly personal and utterly original, this physicist&#x2019;s diary is a breathtaking contemplation of our deep connection with the universe and our aspirations to comprehend it.</p></p><p>"Although we're tantalizingly close to the answer, we still don't know if our universe is infinite or finite. Janna Levin, one of the bright young stars on the interface between topology (the study of shapes) and cosmology, describes her efforts to look for the signatures of a finite universe and offers the reader a unique insight into her life and inner thoughts."--David Spergel, Princeton University <p>"Janna Levin is one of the most talented and original of the young cosmologists, and her book combines a tour of the frontiers of cosmology with an intimate account of her struggles to reconcile the demands of a scientific career with the demands of the heart. No other scientist has yet had the courage to write such an honest and personal account of what it is like to live the life of a scientist."--Lee Smolin, author of <i>The Life of the Cosmos</i> and <i>Three Roads to Quantum Gravity</i></p><p> </p><p>"This is a totally charming piece of work. A memoir of one very talented young woman, it layers her personal odyssey and bits of science like an exotic piece of intellectual/personal pastry. The attitude toward the subject is that of the artist: feelings matter, pictures matter, intuitions matter. Levin's book is a wonderful read that introduces current science from an odd angle in a lively, accessible, and engaging fashion. I have never read a book like it."--Jeremiah P.

From 1986 to 1999, he was on the staff of <i>The Economist</i>, serving in Zimbabwe, London, and Japan, and as the magazine's Washington bureau chief. He spent 2003 as a Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and has written for Foreign Affairs, <i>Foreign Policy</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>The New Republic</i>, among others.<b>Chapter One</b><p>A TALE OF TWO AMBITIONS</p><p>On Friday, September 14, 2001, President George W. Bush led a televised prayer service in Washington's National Cathedral. He invoked the heroes of three days before: inside the World Trade Center, a man who could have saved himself had stayed and died beside his quadriplegic friend; a priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter; two office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down sixty-eight floors to safety. We feel, said the president, what Franklin Roosevelt called the "warm courage of national unity." And he spelled out the next steps. "Our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil."</p><p>Meanwhile another memorial service was under way in another part of Washington. In what passes for the capital's business district, two blocks west of the White House, two thousand people gathered in the glass-fronted atrium of the World Bank's headquarters. In an institution with employees from more than a hundred countries, including a large number of Muslims, the attacks of September 11 had induced a trauma of a special kind. Along with the fear felt by everyone in Washington-that more and nastier attacks might follow soon-there was the fear that life in the United States would become less secure for people with Pakistani or Saudi or Afghan passports. And there was the fear-which only grew as the president's rhetoric evolved-that friends and family abroad could somehow find themselves on the wrong side of a new global divide-the side that President Bush now classified as "evil."</p><p>The World Bankers gathered in the atrium, where the walls rise, cathedral-like, thirteen stories above the marble floor to a roof composed of glass; and where, in place of the baptismal basin and Christian inscription, there is an internal lake fed by an internal waterfall, and a sign proclaiming, OUR DREAM IS A WORLD FREE OF POVERTY. The staff packed into this atrium, displacing the kiosk displays on work stress and business communication that often furnish its vast space, and watched their president face them from a stage: a silver-haired, barrel-chested, twinkly eyed man-a sort of Santa Claus without the beard and costume. "I am not a preacher and I surely don't represent all the religions here," the president began, "but in this room we have a microcosm of the world. We have one hundred forty nations. We have Christians and Muslims and Jews and Buddhists and Sikhs.... We as a family can be a light for each other and for our community and for the world, because we are charged with the most significant challenge of all: to relieve poverty, and to improve the lives of our fellow men, and give our children a chance for peace and hope.... Ours is a noble task," he added.</p><p>To relieve poverty and so create a space for peace: Over the next few weeks James Wolfensohn, who is more of a preacher than he allows, built upon this theme, offering a response to 9/11 that contrasted markedly with President Bush's promise to "rid the world of evil." In Wolfensohn's view, an understanding of the terrorist attacks began with the big picture: In a world of 6 billion people, half lived on less than $2 per day, and a fifth subsisted with not even a dollar. In the next twenty-five years, moreover, the world's population would swell by a further 2 billion, and all but 50 million of these would live in poverty-afflicted countries. Even if no simple link existed between poverty and terrorism, these population numbers surely meant something. In a world with so much poverty, you couldn't just identify a few pockets of terrorism and vow to root them out. Security lay in bringing the excluded in, not in dividing the world into two camps and rooting out the evil one.</p><p>In the past, Wolfensohn would say, you might have overlooked this link between security and poverty. For the fortunate fifth of the world's people, who lived in the countries with four-fifths of the world's income, it had been possible to imagine that a wall separated "them" from "us," that sheer distance-psychic, geographical, or otherwise-could insulate us from the billion people who lacked drinkable water, or the women who perished in childbirth at the rate of one a minute. But after September 11, it was time to realize that global poverty had global reach, whether because it created the failed states that nurtured terrorists, or because it incubated disease, environmental damage, and migration pressures. "There is no wall," Wolfensohn declared. "We are linked by trade, investment, finance, by travel and communications, by disease, by crime, by migration, by environmental degradation, by drugs, by financial crises and by terror."</p><p>If the rich world was going to get serious about fighting global poverty, there was no doubt that the World Bank would lead the effort. It was a presence in almost every poor country in the world, supplying around $20 billion in loans a year, for projects ranging from irrigation systems to anticorruption efforts, from AIDS control to a victorious campaign against river blindness in Africa. The Bank's money, moreover, was just part of its significance; more than any other institution in the world, it understood the complex web of influences that keep people poor, and it set the intellectual agenda for other development agencies. Its ten-thousand-strong staff combined raw brain power with practical experience of four continents. It advised developing countries on which problems they should tackle and how they should proceed, spreading the lessons from these efforts around the world, so that Madagascar might learn from Thailand or Tunisia. Every time the rich world's leaders confronted global problems-whether it was AIDS or female illiteracy or environmental pressures-they turned instinctively to the World Bank. Now, in the wake of 9/11, they were bound to do so once again, and with a new sense of urgency.</p><p>Reacting to the new challenge of terror, President Bush had invoked Franklin Roosevelt. In setting forth his own reaction, Wolfensohn was invoking Roosevelt as well, even though he never mentioned him.</p><p></p><p>The World Bank was conceived six decades before the terrorist attacks, in the teeth of another violent threat to American security. In December 1941, scarcely a week after the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt's long-time friend and treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau, commissioned a blueprint for the postwar economic order. Morgenthau was incapable of designing such a thing himself-he was a gentleman-farmer, not a financier-so he turned to Harry Dexter White, a driven, brilliant Harvard PhD whose service was later rewarded with persecution at the hands of Senator Joseph McCarthy. White's brief was nothing less than to prevent another war, and to do so by forestalling the kind of economic storm that had brought about the current one. As Morgenthau put it a little while later, "all of us have seen the great economic tragedy of our time. We saw the worldwide depression of the 1930s. We saw currency disorders develop and spread from land to land.... We saw unemployment and wretchedness.... We saw bewilderment and bitterness become the breeders of fascism, and, finally, of war."</p><p>White's first priority was to prevent more such "currency disorders." The postwar economic system would be anchored by the gold standard, which would shield commerce from the twin evils of exchange-rate shocks and inflation. If this system came under pressure-if a balance of payments deficit exhausted a nation's gold reserves-a new international lender of last resort would bail the country out rather than leaving it to devalue. This new bail-out lender ultimately took shape as the International Monetary Fund, which today stands across the street from the World Bank in Washington, and which still fights financial crises from Argentina to Turkey. But White's creativity did not stop there. He also conceived the idea of a new public bank that would promote the rebuilding of Europe, so ending the "unemployment and wretchedness" that Morgenthau lamented. At first, the new institution's proposed name-the "Bank for Reconstruction of the United and Associated Nations"-made no reference to the plight of developing countries. But a member of White's team suggested that this bank could play a role beyond the reconstruction of Europe. In a memo circulated in November 1943, the words "and Development" were inserted after Reconstruction in the title.</p><p>Without World War II, and the extraordinary leverage that it afforded the United States, White's plans might have faltered. His main ally abroad was John Maynard Keynes, the preeminent economist of the time, who was then advising Britain's Treasury. Keynes agreed with the outline of the American ideas, but he disagreed on the detail. He took a dim view of White's proposal to convene an international conference to discuss plans for a new world bank; observing that forty-four governments would come, he warned of "the most monstrous monkey-house." But White insisted on the gathering, and Keynes swallowed his distaste: he knew that Britain depended upon American support, both economic and military. In July 1944, when the Allied forces had still not broken out of their Normandy beachhead, several hundred delegates convened in the sprawling Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.</p><p>Even then, the creation of an international bank was by no means certain. The conference invitation proclaimed currency stabilization as the primary goal; creating a bank for reconstruction was a secondary objective. Keynes headed the commission charged with discussing the potential bank's design; he liked the idea of a fresh source of reconstruction funds for Europe, and saw no positive harm in lending whatever might be left to Latin America or India. After a few days of deliberation on whether the new creation might best be termed a "corporation" rather than a "bank," a drafting committee drew up the Bank's Articles of Agreement, opening the way for the long process of amendment. On the last day of the conference, the Soviet delegation demanded five changes-an affront that in retrospect seems doubly irksome, since the Soviets subsequently refused participation in the Bretton Woods institutions. But the Soviets were contained. The drafting was finished. And the conference ended with an agreement on a new International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to work alongside the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>The link between security and poverty had been stressed throughout the conference. As White said to his colleagues, "There is nothing that will serve to drive these countries into some kind of ism-communism or something else-faster than having inadequate capital." But White, like Keynes, was thinking of economic misery in Europe rather than in the developing world; at most, both men regarded development as a useful rationale for the Bank once reconstruction was over. In this, they reflected the spirit of their times. Poverty was even worse then than it is now: in India, life expectancy for the poor was twenty-five years, and 90 percent of the population aged ten or older was illiterate. But this was seen as a fact of life rather than an urgent challenge. In 1948, Paul Samuelson published the first edition of his classic economics textbook. It contained less than three sentences on development.</p><p>And yet, even in the 1940s, it was easy to see how time would soon expand the economists' horizons. The link between security and poverty logically applied to developing countries as well as the developed ones; and the statesmen of the time could see this. "The economic health of every country is a proper matter of concern to all its neighbors, near and distant," said the message read out to delegates at the start of the Bretton Woods conference; "there is no wall," it might just as well have stated. That message-a premonition of Wolfensohn's response to twenty-first-century terror-came from none other than Franklin Roosevelt.</p><p></p><p>James David Wolfensohn knew all about walls: he had spent his life crashing straight through them. He was born on December 1, 1933, and grew up in a modest suburban apartment in Sydney, Australia. His parents had emigrated from England during the Depression, and later helped to resettle the flood of fellow Jewish emigres who arrived in Australia during and after World War II. His mother, Dora, was a musician, and sang every week on the radio; his father adored music, too, and the young Wolfensohn took piano lessons. The parents lavished attention on their two children, and especially their son, who was ten years younger than his sister and so almost an only child. Wolfensohn remembers himself as "pudgy, a very fat little boy. I was indulged by my parents, spoilt probably, and I ate far too much chocolate."</p><p>This indulgence was mixed with something else-something that instilled in the young Wolfensohn a vast and raw ambition. There was a scent of disappointment in the home, of financial stress and thwarted aspiration. The young boy's father-Hyman Wolfensohn, known universally as "Bill"-was proud and intellectual and profoundly frustrated. Early in life, he had studied medicine in London, but his plan to become a doctor had been interrupted by World War I. Later he had begun a law degree, but was distracted from his studies by James Rothschild, a scion of Europe's great banking family, who hired him as his private secretary. Bill Wolfensohn thrived in the service of the Rothschilds, and accumulated enough savings to set off on his own; he moved his family to Australia in search of independent fame and fortune. But by the time his son was entering his teens, Bill Wolfensohn's quest had clearly failed. He had lost the money he had made in London, and had discovered how much harder it was to prosper when severed from the Rothschild name; the small business consultancy he ran made barely enough for the family to survive on. Cut off from his native Europe, Bill Wolfensohn brooded on the far fringe of the world. He lived in a state of financial worry, having rubbed shoulders with plenty. He rued his lowly professional status, having once aspired to join both the medical and legal priesthoods. He could not live his life again. But he was determined that his son should not repeat his errors.</p><p>Half a century later, Jim Wolfensohn still remembers the extraordinary paternal expectations of his youth. He was shoved through his early school years, jumping ahead two grades; when a famous tennis coach suggested that he interrupt his schooling to train for international tournaments, his father wouldn't hear of it. Somewhere in his mid-teens, the pressure grew too much; having entered Sydney Boys High School as a star student, he matriculated four years later with the lowest grades you could get while still qualifying for college. In his first year at university, he failed all his subjects and felt miserable.</p></p><h2>The Rebirth of Druidry: Ancient Earth Wisdom for Today</h2><p>This book compiles articles and essays that examine: the Druid tradition, the Druid as healer, the power of magic in modern Druidry, Druidic ceremonies, festivals and rites of passage, an Druidry&#39;s roots in the love of nature.</p><p>Philip Carr-Gomm is a writer, psychologist, and Druid of world renown.

Velvet topcoats worn with silk ascots, fake British accents that echoed through the theater, a key light focused on an antique rolltop desk piled high with black ledgers. Like that.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect casting,&#x201d; Suzanne Dietz whispered to her friend Toni as they stood backstage. &#x201c;Allan Sharp playing Ebenezer Scrooge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our town curmudgeon scored the ultimate role,&#x201d; Toni chuckled. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s not to like?&#x201d;</p><p>It was Sunday evening, a few weeks before Christmas, and the Kindred Players were holding their first-ever dress rehearsal for A Christmas Carol. Suzanne and Toni had ditched their holiday decorating chores at the Cackleberry Club Caf� in order to help with costumes, sets, and lighting. Now they stood in the darkened wings of the refurbished Oakhurst Theatre, watching their fellow townsfolk do some fairly credible acting.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at Bud Nolden,&#x201d; Toni said. &#x201c;Who would have thought a big gallumping guy who drives a two-ton snowplow would make such a believable Bob Cratchit?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing great,&#x201d; Suzanne said. &#x201c;The entire cast is. They&#x2019;ve learned their lines and are putting real emotion behind them.&#x201d; Suzanne, who&#x2019;d never appeared onstage, never even sung in a high school musical, was delighted to remain in the wings. &#x201c;And take a gander at Mayor Mobley stomping around out there. Even he&#x2019;s giving a hundred and ten percent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which is about what he usually gets after he stuffs the ballot box.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still,&#x201d; Suzanne said. &#x201c;For once Mobley&#x2019;s trying to do his part for the community.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which is more than I can say for myself, because I still haven&#x2019;t figured out which rope raises the curtain and which pulley lowers the backdrop.&#x201d; Toni let out a long sigh. &#x201c;And then there are the confounded lights. I don&#x2019;t know a key light from a klieg, which I guess makes me some kind of dim bulb.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so hard on yourself,&#x201d; Suzanne said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get the bugs worked out. That&#x2019;s what rehearsals are all about.&#x201d; For her own part, Suzanne was struggling with the fog machine, trying to figure out how to make it spew just the right amount of moody mist. Too little and everything was out of focus. Too much and the stage looked like a foggy night in the Okefenokee Swamp.</p><p>&#x201c;I gotta get this locked down,&#x201d; Toni said. &#x201c;Opening night is this coming Saturday and I&#x2019;m so worried that I bit my press-on nails down to their plastic nubbins.&#x201d; She swiped a hand across her stomach. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m getting a case of the whim-whams to boot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; Suzanne said. &#x201c;After everybody leaves the theater tonight, we&#x2019;ll have our own private stagehand rehearsal. Figure out which pulleys do what. We&#x2019;ll label all the ropes if we have to. Light switches, too. That way there&#x2019;ll be no second-guessing on opening night.&#x201d;</p><p>Between Toni and their other partner, Petra, Suzanne was blessed with the cooler head, the more practical approach to everyday life. She was the one who ran interference at the Cackleberry Club, coaxing everyone down from the ledge whenever they dared entertain a harebrained scheme. She also handled the pesky financial and personnel details that made Toni and Petra whimper with fear. In other words, Suzanne was the voice of reason.</p><p>Suzanne, who was a few ticks past the age of forty, was also newly engaged to Dr. Sam Hazelet, the town doctor and her own personal hottie. With her shoulder-length silver-blond hair and cool blue eyes, Suzanne projected an air of self-confidence that was reflected in her penchant for slim-cut blue jeans and suede jackets, which was the exact combo she was wearing tonight.</p><p>Toni, on the other hand, was the Cackleberry Club&#x2019;s self-proclaimed hoochie momma. She favored silver-studded jeans and skintight cowgirl shirts that showed off her cha-chas, and she had never seen a piece of fake Dynel hair that she didn&#x2019;t want to clip into her own mop of reddish blond hair.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize this show had such a large cast,&#x201d; Toni said. She held her breath as she flipped a switch, dimming the lights right on cue as a half dozen actors milled about onstage. &#x201c;Ooh, I did it,&#x201d; she cooed softly. They were coming to the end of the second act and she was still nervous about dropping the curtain. &#x201c;Eeny, meeny&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Toni grasped a thick red rope that led to an overhead tangle of ropes and pulleys. &#x201c;Is this the right one or should I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d;</p><p>Actors streamed past them, coming off the stage and disappearing into the back of the theater: Nolden, Mobley, and six others.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drop the curtain yet,&#x201d; Suzanne hissed. &#x201c;You need to dim the lights because the ghost still has to come out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Toni swatted a switch with the flat of her hand and the entire stage went dark.</p><p>&#x201c;Not that dark,&#x201d; Suzanne said. &#x201c;The audience has to be able to see something.&#x201d;</p><p>Toni&#x2019;s fingers crawled along the entire panel of light switches and settled on one. &#x201c;Maybe this one?&#x201d; She flicked the switch and a weird blue light filtered down from above.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the ticket,&#x201d; Suzanne whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I am starting to get the hang of things,&#x201d; Toni said. She sounded relieved and a little more confident in her ability as a stagehand.</p><p>Suzanne bent down and turned on the fog machine. Instantly, a jet of white fog spewed out and spread across the entire stage.</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa, that might be a bit much,&#x201d; Toni cautioned.</p><p>Suzanne dialed her machine back, got it running just right, and then glanced at her script. She was trying to follow along in the dim light. &#x201c;Okay, so the ghost is supposed to enter stage right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here he comes.&#x201d;</p><p>They watched as the ghost floated out right on cue. There was a hush from the other actors, who were all seated in the first few rows of the theater, watching the play, waiting for the next act, when it would be their turn to strut their stuff onstage.</p><p>The ghost, dressed in long gray robes and a deep cowl that hid his face in darkness, drifted dramatically about the stage.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is that?&#x201d; Toni asked as they peered out from the wings.</p><p>Suzanne shook her head. &#x201c;No idea. I wasn&#x2019;t here when Teddy Hardwick had the casting call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But the ghost is good. Very believable. Whoever it is.&#x201d;</p><p>The ghost postured importantly and lifted his arms as if he were some sort of avenging spirit. &#x201c;Ooooh.&#x201d; His hollow tones rippled across the stage and filled the near-empty theater.</p><p>&#x201c;Spooky,&#x201d; Suzanne said. &#x201c;And very realistic.&#x201d; She made a mental note to find out who&#x2019;d created the ghost costume. With its gray-green color and straggly bits of cheesecloth hanging down, the shroud was very convincing. Like the ghost had actually swept in from the great beyond.</p><p>&#x201c;This is, like, the best part so far,&#x201d; Toni said. She was watching the action with rapt attention.</p><p>Suddenly, the ghost darted in close to the Scrooge character and embraced him as he sat at his desk.</p><p>&#x201c;Scrooooge,&#x201d; the ghost lamented. &#x201c;Scrooooge.&#x201d;</p><p>Then Scrooge and the ghost seemed to merge into a single image for a few moments, doing some kind of ethereal dance. The ghost released Scrooge and then floated off into the wings on the opposite side of the stage.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the ticket,&#x201d; Toni said. She grasped the rheostat and slowly dimmed the blue lights to a pale glow that practically pulsed with electrical energy.</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Suzanne whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;Suzanne?&#x201d; came a worried voice from behind her.</p><p>Suzanne whirled around to find Bill Probst, one of the owners of the Kindred Bakery, staring at her. His face was scrunched into a nervous expression and he wore a ghost costume made of gray netting.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Bill said, &#x201c;but I completely missed my cue.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Suzanne blinked rapidly and glanced out at the stage, where Allan Sharp as Scrooge was slowly slumping over his rolltop desk, practically moving in slow motion.</p><p>&#x201c;And now the curtain,&#x201d; Toni said with a triumphant yelp. She had her back to them, hadn&#x2019;t even seen Bill yet, as she released the pulley and a heavy damask curtain came thudding down.</p><p>But Suzanne was still staring out at the stage. Hold everything, she thought, her mind making a series of nervous blips. If the ghost is standing right next to me, then who just acted that scene with Allan Sharp?</p><p>&#x201c;How about an encore?&#x201d; Toni asked. She raised the curtain halfway up and then glanced toward the stage.</p><p>Allan Sharp was still sprawled at his desk as eerie blue light filtered down. His head was bowed low and he looked as if he&#x2019;d fallen into a trance.</p><p>A thin spatter of applause rose from the actors sitting in the first couple of rows. They seemed deeply impressed by such a dramatic climax. But a few moments after their applause died down, Sharp still hadn&#x2019;t made a move to get up and take a well-deserved bow.</p><p>Is this method acting? Suzanne wondered. Or is something a lot more sinister going on?</p><p>Just as Suzanne was about to react, Toni jammed an elbow into her ribs and whispered, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think Sharp is overplaying his role? I mean, he isn&#x2019;t Jeremy Irons and this isn&#x2019;t exactly the Globe Theatre.&#x201d;</p><p>Sharp still hadn&#x2019;t moved a muscle, and Suzanne was slowly, almost unwillingly, putting it all together. Connecting the dots between the mysterious ghost, the almost deathlike embrace, and Allan Sharp flopped out there in a heap.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy cats,&#x201d; Suzanne gasped. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s acting!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Toni cried.</p><p>&#x201c;I think Sharp is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Without finishing her words, Suzanne rushed out onto the stage. She circled Allan Sharp&#x2019;s crumpled body, reached out a hand to touch the pulse point at his neck, and felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. absolutely nothing. There was no sign of breathing, no other vital signs.</p><p>Shocked, practically reeling from her grisly discovery, Suzanne spun about and gazed down at a dozen questioning faces in the audience. &#x201c;Call 911!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Something terrible has happened to Allan Sharp!&#x201d;</p><p>The cast and crew all froze for a long moment, until a few of them had the presence of mind to fumble for their phones. By that time, Suzanne had already turned and sprinted past Toni. Then she dove into the gloom and darkness of the theater&#x2019;s backstage.</p><p>Suzanne could hear footsteps&#x2014;hasty, running footsteps&#x2014;just ahead of her but could barely see her hand in front of her face. The entire backstage was dark as a tomb except for a single red exit light way at the back. As she dodged past a rack of costumes, in hot pursuit of the mysterious fleeing ghost, she shivered. The dim red light made the Victorian sets look as if they were bathed in blood.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; Suzanne shouted. Her voice reverberated back at her as she spun around a row of dressing rooms and spotted the ghost some ten paces ahead of her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking to you,&#x201d; she yelled.</p><p>The ghost ignored her completely, flinging out a hand to tip over a wooden crate.</p><p>Suzanne stumbled, one knee going down to hit the cold cement floor. Then she righted herself and leapt clumsily over the crate. Up ahead, the ghost was moving quickly again, crashing through set decorations, knocking over a Victorian streetlamp, and heading for the back door.</p><p>Suzanne pushed herself harder and dodged around a corner, past a dusty grouping of old furniture. Way back here, in the bowels of the old theater, the air was musty and filled with the smell of mildew and rot. Her heart hammered; her temples throbbed with rushing blood. It was like being in a tomb&#x2014;dark and silent&#x2014;only she wasn&#x2019;t alone.</p><p>She spun around another corner, saw gray cheesecloth fluttering ahead of her, and followed it down a clattering flight of metal stairs.</p><p>At the bottom Suzanne hesitated. Was this a good idea? Where was the ghost? Was he lying in wait for her?</p><p>Suzanne glanced about for some sort of weapon. In the dim light she saw folding chairs, stacks of old newspapers, and a toolbox. Her hand swept out and grabbed a rusty hammer. She hefted it carefully, feeling the weight, hoping it would be enough of a defense weapon if she needed one.</p><p>Sliding ahead, slowly and quietly, Suzanne tried to pick her way through the gloom.</p><p>Was the ghost waiting to attack her? He&#x2019;d already killed one person, so he probably had no qualms about adding another victim to his dance card.</p><p>A narrow hallway loomed ahead of her. Her back against the wall, Suzanne eased herself forward.</p><p>And there, just ahead of her, heading for the back door of the theater, was the ghost.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; Suzanne cried as she scrambled after him.</p><p>The ghost slid to a halt and spun around to face her, all dark cowl and quivering cheesecloth. Holding up a mean-looking serrated knife that glistened with a few beads of blood, he jabbed the tip at her.</p><p>Suzanne backpedaled mightily, her heart practically beating out of her chest.</p><p>Holy crap!</p><p>Wide-eyed and practically breathless, Suzanne stood and stared at the ghost. The heavy cowl still obliterated his face; the knife was clutched in his hand. She took one cautious step backward. And then another.</p><p>What was I thinking? This is such a bad idea.</p><p>The ghost raised his knife and then tilted it in a perpendicular fashion, almost as if he was making some kind of medieval symbol or benediction.</p><p>Suzanne&#x2019;s heart fluttered with fear. Had Toni called 911? Had anyone followed her back here? Was she about to become this madman&#x2019;s next victim?</p><p>Then, with eerie but coordinated stealth, the ghost whirled about and kicked open the heavy metal stage door. A draft of ice-cold air flowed in as the door banged hollowly against the outside wall, launching a miniature snowstorm of ice rime. Seconds later, the ghost flitted outside, its footsteps crunching hollowly as he disappeared down the back alley into the frozen, dark night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>It was both a tragedy and a comedy of errors. A tragedy because a man had bled to death onstage, a comedy because Toni was convinced he&#x2019;d been murdered by an honest-to-goodness ghost.</p><p>&#x201c;The temperature must have dropped thirty degrees when that phantom started whooshing around,&#x201d; Toni said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m positive I smelled something strange.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strange like what?&#x201d; Suzanne asked.</p><p>Toni scrunched her face and made a wringing motion with her hands. &#x201c;Maybe like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brimstone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure it wasn&#x2019;t just cheap drugstore aftershave?&#x201d; Suzanne asked. Nothing here was particularly funny but she still struggled to keep a straight face.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I think that ghost blew up from the pit of hell.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheriff Roy Doogie and Deputy Eddie Driscoll had shown up at the theater almost immediately. They&#x2019;d rushed down the center aisle in a flurry of khaki, snorkel parkas, and pac boots and checked Allan Sharp&#x2019;s body to make sure he really was dead. Then they listened carefully to Suzanne&#x2019;s eyewitness account of the murder and subsequent chase. Toni&#x2019;s explanation, however, had left them scratching their heads.</p><p>&#x201c;It was a real ghost,&#x201d; Toni insisted.</p><p>&#x201c;If it was a genuine ghost I was chasing, then he was wearing genuine Sorel boots,&#x201d; Suzanne said. &#x201c;I saw them as he hoofed it out the back door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you didn&#x2019;t see his face?&#x201d; Sheriff Doogie asked Suzanne.&lt;...</p></p><h2>Sleep of the Unjust</h2><p>Felix Freer joins forces with his ex-wife Virginia to tackle a mystery at a wedding that involves a dead movie star, a spurious letter, and a murdered woman</p><p>The amicably separated Freers--Felix and Virginia (I Met Murder, 1986, etc.)--meet again as houseguests of George and Christine Appleyard on the eve of the wedding of Christine's niece Sonia to biochemist David Eldred.

It also describes more recent efforts to restore the ship and put it on display in Boston.</p><p>This is the story of the oldest war ship afloat in the world, the venerable frigate U.S.S. Constitution, the cornerstone of the nascent American navy created by an act of Congress in 1794. Having seen its first action against Barbary pirates in 1803-05, the ship went on to heroics during the War of 1812, during which it acquired the nickname &#34;Old Ironsides&#34; after a British sailor observed a cannon ball bouncing off its side. Later used as a training ship and for good will tours around the globe, the ship was ultimately brought to Boston and restored, where it remains today as a floating museum and enduring symbol of the Age of Sail.

Nixon continues to fascinate us. Many books have been written about Nixon, and about Watergate, but perhaps none sheds so revealing a light on the late president as Stanley I. Kutler's <i>Abuse of Power</i>. In the years following Watergate, as Nixon fought to rebuild his reputation from the ruins of his shattered presidency, he fought fiercely to suppress publication of most of the secret tapes that led to his downfall. During his lifetime, only about 60 hours of the almost 4,000 that exist were ever made public, and even after his death his estate continued to obstruct further releases. Then, in 1996, Kutler, along with the advocacy group Public Citizen, won a landmark decision to release the tapes. <p> Among other things, <i>Abuse of Power</i> definitively answers the question of whether Nixon was directly involved in raising hush money (he was) and suggests a reason for the burglary attempt at the Watergate Hotel (financial documents that might have linked the Democratic Party chairman to Howard Hughes). The tapes also reveal the vindictive and bigoted side to Nixon's personality, particularly as he discusses "killing" the <i>Washington Post</i>, and blames <i>rich Jews</i> for Billy Graham's tax problems. <i>Abuse of Power</i> only covers an additional 201 hours of tape of the near 4,000 that remain unreleased. It seems that the final chapter on Watergate has yet to be written.</p><p>Richard Nixon said he wanted his administration to be "the best chronicled in history." But when Alexander Butterfield disclosed the existence of a voice-activated taping system to a Senate committee in July 1973, Nixon's White House and its recordings quickly became the most infamous in American history. The tapes dominated the final two years of Nixon's presidency, and almost single-handedly forced his resignation. </p><p>But only 60 hours were actually made public in the 1970s. Many thousands of hours remained secret and in Nixon's hands, and he fought fiercely to keep them that way right up to his death. Finally, thanks to a lawsuit brought by historian Stanley I. Kutler with the advocacy group Public Citizen, a landmark 1996 settlement with the Nixon estate and the National Archives is bringing over 3,000 hours of tapes to light. The initial release in November 1996 of over 200 hours of material comprised all those conversations concerning abuse of power -- every Watergate-related tape, as well as those concerning many other campaign misdeeds and some Pentagon Papers discussions. Finally, the full story of Nixon's downfall can be told. </p><p> From Ehrlichman's saying, "Dean's been admonished not to contrive a story that's liable not to succeed" to Nixon's asking, "Is the line pretty well set now on, when asked about Watergate, as to what everybody says and does, to stonewall?" <i>Abuse of Power</i> reveals a much more extensive cover-up than ever realized. From Colson's announcing, "Well, we did a little dirty trick this morning" to Nixon's ordering a McGovern watch "around the clock" to the planting of a spy in Ted Kennedy's Secret Service detail, <i>Abuse of Power</i> redefines the meaning of campaign tactics. And from a worried discussion of Dwayne Andreas's "bag man" to Nixon's stating that the burglars "have to be paid. That's all there is to that," to a quiet conversation with Rose Mary Woods to see if there remained $100,000 in his safe for "a campaign thing that we're talking about," here is a money trail that anyone can follow. </p><p>Packed with revelations on almost every page, the <i>Abuse of Power</i> tapes offer a spellbinding portrait of raw power and a Shakespearean depiction of a king and his court. Never have the personalities of Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Colson, Haig, Kissinger, Dean, and Mitchell been so vividly captured with the spoken word. And never has an American President offered such a revealing record of his darkest self.</p></p><h2>The 21st Century Sniper: A Complete Practical Guide</h2><p>Modernizing the outdoor, survival industry with it&#39;s innovative products, Pro force equipment is the choice of all levels of outdoorsman.</p><p><strong></strong><strong>Brandon Webb</strong> is a former combat decorated U.S. Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer.

Enjoy reading! In one of his letters Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote once: &#x201c;In eternity I will be asked how I&#x2019;ve used my talent, what I&#x2019;ve done for human beings...&#x201d; If you have read this book, perhaps that means the Little Prince has tamed you, too, that he&#x2019;s become the child living in your heart, too, who helps you to repent, to purify yourself again and again. Perhaps you have revealed, too, that the spiritual ties are the strongest, that sometimes it is simply enough to take care of a flower to be happy... In the novel of &#x201c;The Little Prince&#x201d;, in this cozy treasury of universal and spiritual values, we find the real beauty and truth, so simple and concealed at the same time. And we realize deep in our soul what this child&#x2019;s mission was... We see a child who could make water flow in the desert, who loved and devoted himself to all with his entire soul, who understood the language of heart and who knew the spiritual things. Saint-Exupery carried his Little Prince with him through all his life, never let him alone at any crossroads of life and lived as the Little Prince did, being ready to give his life for a friend, never placing body higher than soul, loving his homeland, remaining child in soul and dreaming, falling and flying... &#x201c;The Captain of Birds&#x201d; was free-minded, indeed. And he flew for the last time, made a slit into the white clouds by his airplane and hovered to the sparkling stars, to the promising unknown... I don&#x2019;t think Saint-Ex will be asked many questions in eternity: it is sufficient to see all the hearts he poured with warmness and reminded the art of loving...</p><p>Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry first published <i>The Little Prince</i> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. "In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey," the narrator recalls. "Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket." And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exup�ry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote>I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. "Trying to be witty," we're told at one point, "leads to lying, more or less." But Saint-Exup�ry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>First published in 1943<br>Previous hardcover edition 2000<br>0-15-202398-4<br></p><h2>Stand Tall, Molly Lou Melon [Modern Gem]</h2><p>Even when the class bully at her new school makes fun of her, Molly remembers what her grandmother told her and she feels good about herself.</p><p>Molly Lou Melon may be tiny, clumsy, buck-toothed, and with a voice "like a bullfrog being squeezed by a boa constrictor," but she doesn't mind. Her grandmother has utmost confidence in her, and tells her at every turn to believe in herself. "Sing out clear and strong and the world will cry tears of joy," Grandma says. But Molly Lou's self-assurance is put to the test when she moves to a new town, away from her friends and beloved grandmother.

It was a bounty, this white hair; it was dimension; it was the new her, the new them, a token of the hell they'd been through and the hell they'd put each other through and, most of all, the unexpected glory of having somehow found their way back.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd hate it, of course, if she knew it was there. She'd have plucked it by now, and no doubt have started a conversation with her stylist about whether it was time to start coloring. So it must have kept itself a secret, this singleton, hiding behind the ones sprouting closer to the crown, betrayed this morning only by the random splay of her thick mane on the pillow, and only to Waldo. Which would make her hate it even more: she'd rather die than show weakness, to him or to anyone. In fact, but a month ago he had believed she'd made that very choice, only to learn that she'd faked her death by propping a finagled corpse behind the wheel of her sort of husband's sort of borrowed Porsche under a Santa Clarita overpass, then dousing car and cadaver in gasoline and setting them both ablaze-and doing it all, Waldo was willing to bet, in the usual killer stilettos.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd also hate his knowing because, while she treated unabridged knowledge of everything about Waldo as something like a prerogative, she herself was furtive in countless ways and expected him to accept that. Which he did. But here the first late spring daylight was peeking through the slats of her plantation shutters and revealing a secret about her very body, a bulletin that he'd read and she hadn't, which he cherished and she wouldn't. All of that made Lorena Nascimento's first white hair in this moment the sexiest thing about her, and, Lord Almighty, that was saying something.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He pressed against her backside, testing how deeply she slept. Not deeply enough, he was pleased to find; she reached back for him and shifted to make herself available, liking it this way early in the morning, and raised her head just enough to let him slip an arm under her neck. As he crushed his lips to the locks against her nape she let out a sleepy purr, all the more fetching in her unawareness of what it was he was worshipping so.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His natural inclination to rise early reinforced by the habits of three years in the woods, Waldo knew he wouldn't fall back asleep. He listened to Lorena's breathing slow and deepen, one more little pleasure he hadn't realized how much he'd missed. Goddamn, he thought, it was good to be back with her, but goddamn, it was complicated, navigating the orthodoxies he'd adopted since the last time.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The past month, in fact, seemed like nothing but sex and negotiation. It was hard even to find a place to spend a night together; uncomfortable as he felt at her house, it was still, when she had it to herself, their least bad option. In his tiny cabin there'd be no sleeping space for her unless she took his loft, leaving him to curl up on the floor between the sink and the desk. One time they tried a hotel in Idyllwild but its shower alone overwhelmed his zero-footprint sensibility with its casual outrages, from the non-low-flow head to the tiny plastic bottles of shampoo and conditioner and body wash and lotion; the very thought of the megajoules required to manufacture each, just to give some tourist a single partial use before a chambermaid tossed the bottle and remaining contents into a garbage can on the way to a landfill where the leftovers would seep into the groundwater and the container could take centuries to degrade, led Waldo to dry quickly and scurry from the bathroom. He threw on his clothes while Lorena watched from the downy bed in a gauzy postcoital torpor, nonplussed but indulgent, almost amused. He biked to his cabin to sleep, then rode the few miles back to see her in the morning.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to blend their lives, even a little, presented bottomless challenges. One day, flush in physical love, Lorena had presented him with a light purple Hugo Boss dress shirt made of Italian cotton. She didn't mean it as a challenge to his Hundred Things-she'd figured he could replace one of his two work shirts, or maybe choose another possession to shed when he got back to his cabin-but it threw him into a spin nonetheless; the whole point was that the Hundred were painstakingly selected, that nothing was easy to discard, that there'd never be room for a possession so frivolous, and they'd quarreled.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They'd also quarreled over frying pans. Waldo had set out to scramble some eggs on his first morning in her house, only to discover that, oddly, there wasn't a single skillet in the otherwise fully appointed kitchen. When Lorena brought home a two-piece Calphalon set from Williams-Sonoma that afternoon, Waldo felt she should get rid of a Thing-or, better, two-to offset the purchase. She argued that the Things were his rule, not hers, and that she could have as many possessions as she cared to. But this Thing was for his use, he countered, and therefore a de facto cheat of his Hundred. She must have found something appealing underneath his scolding, because she reached into his pants, tabling the debate.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now Waldo remembered one Thing Lorena did have, which predated him and was thus devoid of moral complication: a top-of-the-line Omega masticating juicer, which sat waiting in the kitchen for him and for the oranges he'd bought at the L.A. Farmers Market the evening before. He sat up, poked a toe under the bed and found his boxers. Sliding them on, he watched the gentle rise and fall of the sheet atop Lorena and marveled for the thousandth time at how everything had turned out. There was no woman like her, and they were each other's again.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He slipped out of the bedroom and headed toward the kitchen. Yes, there were squabbles over shirts and kitchenware, but these were a lot less taxing than the bloodier skirmishes of the old days, over things like fidelity and jealousy and commitment. So while you couldn't quite call it easy, this Lorena &amp; Waldo 2.0, it was definitely easier.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These cheery thoughts were interrupted by the appearance of an unexpected penis.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was attached to Willem Vander Janssen, Lorena's beauteous husband. He had been working overseas and wasn't due back until the next day-but here he was, standing at the center island of the kitchen with an array of fruits and vegetables and a knife and carving board and the masticating Omega before him, juicing in the nude. "Hey," he said, casually, as if he and Waldo, near strangers, had on more than one pair of boxers between them.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey," said Waldo.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Willem and Lorena were theoretically separated but had decided to share their house until they could figure out the best way to dispose of their joint ownership. They were cordial enough cohabitants, notwithstanding Lorena's torching of Willem's ninety-thousand-dollar car, about which he apparently remained oblivious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>But his nakedness-what did it mean? It could simply be that Willem was preternaturally comfortable with his body. After all, he was nude on a billboard on Sunset, not two miles from here-in a slightly abridged view, perhaps, but that was just a matter of logo placement. Or was he marking his territory? Had he come out here knowing Waldo was in the house, wanting to remind the interloper padding about in his underwear that he was still Lorena's husband, and that during Waldo's three years as a hermit, he had laid a claim on her so physically intoxicating that she'd actually married him, where as she and Waldo had never so much as lived together?<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More troubling was the notion that Willem would have been just as nude had it been Lorena walking into the kitchen. Shouldn't their "estrangement" have triggered some sort of modesty? Just how cordial were they? Lorena and Waldo had established no "rules" to this reunion. Was she screwing her husband on the sly, while her lover was out of town?<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Willem said, "The last day of the shoot got rained out. Ever been to the Azores?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Beautiful," he said, turning to face Waldo full on, nothing but friendly. "You should totally go." There didn't seem to be a hair on his body below his jaw. How did these male models get that way? Shave? Wax? Felicitous disease? Willem poured himself a glass of thick green extract and downed half of it in a gulp. To any hygienic concerns about preparing food without clothing, his perfection stood as its own rebuke; he was Michelangelo's David, fortifying himself for another day under the world's gaze with a healthful dose of enzymes and antioxidants. Still and all, Waldo resolved to find something other than juicing to do with his oranges.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He returned to Lorena's bedroom and found her sitting up and checking her phone. "I thought I heard voices," she said.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mm," said Waldo. "Daddy's home." He crawled back in beside her, looking around the meager bedroom. Willem had somehow managed to appropriate the master. "How long you think you'll live here?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why?" she said with a chuckle. "Think we should get a place together? You can't even get through a night in a hotel, for fuck's sake."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wondered what had made him court trouble with a chancy question like that. Actually, he knew full well: it was the penis in the kitchen. "I'm not saying that."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She continued as if he hadn't answered. "You'd probably want us to share Two Hundred Things. I couldn't get down to two hundred blouses." She slid down and rolled on top of him. "I love you. And I love that we're together."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Me, too."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How about we have an understanding?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Uh-oh." They were careening into the badlands. With one flash of insecurity he'd jeopardized everything.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Doesn't have to be 'uh-oh.' How about until we figure out where this is going, we just agree not to see other people?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Easy for me. I didn't see any people for three years." She giggled. They locked eyes, sealing the deal without needing to say it.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Now," she said, crossing her hands on his chest and resting her chin on them, "can we talk about something really important? The reporter still wants to sit down with you." Of course he did. Waldo was a big story-again-since coming out of his self-imposed exile to solve a spectacular Hollywood murder case, that of Monica Pinch, found beaten to death and locked in a house with her TV star husband, a violent blackout drunk who claimed not to remember what happened. For legal purposes, Waldo worked the Pinch case as a nominal employee of Lorena's agency. Afterward, trying to capitalize on the notoriety, Lorena hired a publicist, who persuaded the L.A. Times to do a feature on her.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she wasn't actually talking about the Times article, which they both knew was merely a conversational gateway to the proposal she'd refrained from reviving for the whole week: that Waldo return to detective work full-time, as her partner. She was sure his name on the door would be a Golconda, that all the celebrity work in town would come their way. For Waldo, though, it was all too much to contemplate, starting with the very idea of moving back to the city.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, though, she had a new pitch. "You wouldn't even have to do much. Live in Idyllwild if you want. Come into town when you're in the mood." She tilted her head and flashed her eyebrows. "Or once in a while for a meeting when we need you to show your face. Only work a case if something comes along you actually care about."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The variation gave him something to consider, but he gave her his usual wordless no, for now, by screwing up his face and smiling with his eyes. She responded with her usual sigh and pushed herself off of him and the bed.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Wait-where you going?" He raised a hand, an invitation.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Can't, marathon man. I've got to drive down to Newport Beach. Some of us do have to work."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Newport Beach?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"New business."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Peep show?" Marital investigations, which he disdained, made up the bulk of her practice. She continued into the bathroom without contradicting it.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I guess I'll head back," he said, meaning his cabin.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She came right out. "No." Waldo tipped his head toward the door: we're not alone anymore. "Don't go," she said. "Please?" Such a direct entreaty was unlike her. "Hang around one more day," she offered. "I'll meet you tonight in Santa Monica"-she was alluding to a very green restaurant they'd been frequenting-"and then I'll blow some of my Newport Beach money on a hotel." Waldo started to object but she cut him off. "I did some research. Sustainable stay." She didn't care a whit about any of this, naturally; it was all for him. "The bedding is made from recycled plastic bottles, and they've got a waterless urinal in every room. We'll be ballin' out of control."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had him and she knew it. She turned back into the bathroom, her hair whipping too fast for him to catch one more glimpse of the resplendent thread.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TWO<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A month earlier, Lorena resurfaced after her gasoline stunt and offered Waldo a lift back to his cabin in Idyllwild. Waldo got into her Mercedes. They weren't even out of Burbank when she mentioned that Willem had left that morning for a fragrance shoot in Miami Beach; they turned the car around and headed straight for her bedroom, which they barely left for the next four days.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then her husband returned and jerked Waldo out of their private euphoria. He was instantly abashed by the debauchery of those four days-not the sex, but the ethical blight. It had started with that first accepted ride, a brazen flout of the iron rules that had once redeemed him. Worse, floating on a half-week-long endorphin buzz, he had let her keep ordering in food from a pernicious enterprise, new to Waldo, called Grubhub. The meals were varied and delicious and Lorena cannily accepted the deliveries and plated the food out of his vision, allowing him a blind eye to the extraneous bags and plastic utensils she must have been discarding, not to mention the surely less-than-green practices of the originating restaurants, let alone the wanton atmospheric brutality of twice-a-day automobile deliveries.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He'd defiled himself.

Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination in 1968 seemed like it should be an open-and-shut case. Many people crowded in the small room at Los Angeles&#x2019;s famed Ambassador Hotel that fateful night and saw Sirhan Sirhan pull the trigger. Sirhan was also convicted of the crime and still languishes in jail with a life sentence. However, conspiracy theorists have jumped on inconsistencies in the eyewitness testimony and alleged anomalies in the forensic evidence to suggest that Sirhan was only one shooter in a larger conspiracy, a patsy for the real killers, or even a hypnotized assassin who did not know what he was doing (a popular plot in Cold War&#x2013;era fiction, such as <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>). <br><br>Mel Ayton profiles Sirhan and presents a wealth of evidence about his fanatical Palestinian nationalism and his hatred for RFK that motivated the killing. Ayton unearths neglected eyewitness accounts and overlooked forensic evidence and examines Sirhan&#x2019;s extensive personal notebooks. He revisits the trial proceedings and convincingly shows Sirhan was in fact the lone assassin whose politically motivated act was a forerunner of present-day terrorism. <i>The Forgotten Terrorist</i> is the definitive book on the assassination that rocked the nation during the turbulent summer of 1968.<br></p><p><p>"I am a recognized expert on the murder of Senator Kennedy, but I learned a great deal from <i>The Forgotten Terrorist</i>, especially about Sirhan's family background and his `Palestinian nationalism.' The exquisite detail contained in this well-written, wonderfully researched work makes it a must-read for anyone studying this far from open-and-shut case." <b>-- Dan E. Moldea, author of <i>The Killing of Robert F. Kennedy: An Investigation of Motive, Means, and Opportunity</i></b> </p><p>"Mel Ayton has accomplished something that no one writing about the RFK assassination has ever achieved before. By combining a judicious review of the forensic and eyewitness evidence with a firm grasp of the historical context, Ayton has finally made sense of the 1968 killing. <i>The Forgotten Terrorist</i> is a long overdue reminder that assassination is political murder." <b>-- Max Holland, writer for <i>The Nation</i> and author of <i>The Kennedy Assassination Tapes </i></b> </p><p>"Ayton has produced a significant book with original and detailed information and analyses regarding Sirhan's life, motivation and psychology, we well as the crime itself, which includes new forensic evidence published in three appendices. . . .After reading this compelling comprehensive work, the truth about this case seems obvious." <b>--Patricia Lambert, History News Network</b> </p><p>"<i>The Forgotten Terrorist</i> is superlative, especially in regards to Sirhan's political obsessions and background. The greatest riddle in any of these high profile assassinations is motive. Thanks to Mel Ayton, the RFK killing can now be removed from that list of mysteries. I now recommend this book as the first and last book to read on the case." <b>--Gus Russo, author of <i>The Outfit</i> and <i>Supermob</i></b></p>Mel Ayton has written numerous books and articles, including <i>A Racial Crime</i>, the story of Dr. Martin Luther King&#x2019;s assassin, and <i>The Forgotten Terrorist: Sirhan Sirhan and the Assassination of Robert F.

The biography throws new light on Beckett&#39;s stormy relationship with his mother, the psychotherapy he received after the death of his father and his crucial relationship with James Joyce. There is also material on Beckett&#39;s six-month visit to Germany as the Nazi&#39;s tightened their grip.;The book includes unpublished material on Beckett&#39;s personal life after he chose to live in France, including his own account of his work for a Resistance cell during the war, his escape from the Gestapo and his retreat into hiding.;Obsessively private, Beckett was wholly committed to the work which eventually brought his public fame, beginning with the controversial success of &#34;Waiting for Godot&#34; in 1953, and culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969.;James Knowlson is the general editor of &#34;The Theatrical Notebooks of Samuel Beckett&#34;.</p><p>Samuel Beckett, a talent so exceptional that he created masterpieces in both French and English, shied away from the limelight for much of his life. However James Knowlson, in this amazing biography, shows Beckett wasn't entirely hesitant to talk about himself; the book relies heavily on interviews with Beckett to reconstruct the writer's dizzying career. Knowlson fills the pages with exhaustive detail--some major, some minor. In addition, he analyzes the influences on and evolution of Beckett's work. Through it all a larger picture emerges, one of the artist at work and in life. <b>Damned to Fame</b> is a necessary addition to any study of Beckett.James Knowlson is Emeritus Professor of French at the University of Reading where he founded the Beckett Archive (now the Beckett International Foundation). He was a friend of Samuel Beckett for twenty years and is his authorised biographer, publishing Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett with Bloomsbury in 1996. He has written or edited many other books and essays on Beckett and modern drama, including most recently Images of Beckett with theatre photographer John Haynes.</p><h2>Political Emotions: Why Love Matters for Justice</h2><p><p>How can we achieve and sustain a "decent" liberal society, one that aspires to justice and equal opportunity for all and inspires individuals to sacrifice for the common good? In this book, a continuation of her explorations of emotions and the nature of social justice, Martha Nussbaum makes the case for love. Amid the fears, resentments, and competitive concerns that are endemic even to good societies, public emotions rooted in love--in intense attachments to things outside our control--can foster commitment to shared goals and keep at bay the forces of disgust and envy.</p><p>Great democratic leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, Mohandas Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr., have understood the importance of cultivating emotions. But people attached to liberalism sometimes assume that a theory of public sentiments would run afoul of commitments to freedom and autonomy. Calling into question this perspective, Nussbaum investigates historical proposals for a public "civil religion" or "religion of humanity" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill, and Rabindranath Tagore. She offers an account of how a decent society can use resources inherent in human psychology, while limiting the damage done by the darker side of our personalities. And finally she explores the cultivation of emotions that support justice in examples drawn from literature, song, political rhetoric, festivals, memorials, and even the design of public parks.</p><p>"Love is what gives respect for humanity its life," Nussbaum writes, "making it more than a shell." <i>Political Emotions</i> is a challenging and ambitious contribution to political philosophy.</p></p><p>Martha C. Nussbaum is Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago.[<b>Nussbaum</b>] maps out the routes by which men and women who begin in self-interest and ingrained prejudice can build a society in which what she calls &#x2018;public emotions&#x2019; operate to enlarge the individual&#x2019;s &#x2018;circle of concern&#x2019;...Those who would extend the sympathy individuals feel to include fellow citizens of whatever views, ethnicity, ability or disability must &#x2018;create stable structures of concern that extend compassion broadly.&#x2019; Those structures cannot be exclusively rational and philosophical--as they tend to be in the work of John Rawls and other Kantian liberals--but must, says Nussbaum, be political in the sense that they find expression in the visible machinery of public life...It is one of the virtues of Nussbaum&#x2019;s book that she neither shrinks from sentimentality (how could she, given her title and subtitle?) nor fears being judged philosophically unsophisticated. (Stanley Fish <i>New York Times</i> 2013-10-14)<br><br><b>Nussbaum</b> [is] one of the finest theorists on law and ethics...Her journey is a <i>tour de force </i>that travels through Greek and Indian epics, the music of Mozart in &#x2018;The marriage of Figaro,&#x2019; the poems of Rabindranath Tagore and Walt Whitman, the rhetorical speeches of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., the writings of John Stuart Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, B.R. Ambedkar, Auguste Comte and John Rawls to make a case for establishing just societies by foregrounding emotions that can be developed through critical reasoning...Then she, with incisive brilliance, investigates three emotions that pose special problems for compassionate citizenship: fear, envy and shame and also explain that some societies instead of combating them make the situation worse...Her <i>magnum opus</i>. (A. S. Panneerselvan <i>The Hindu</i> 2013-10-28)<br><br>There&#x2019;s no more interesting or persuasive writer on the wider and connected subjects of emotions and social justice than <b>Martha Nussbaum</b>...Here she brings together strands that go back to her own <i>The Fragility Of Goodness</i> (1986), and in the process delivers a book as important in its way as John Rawls&#x2019;s definitive but slightly bloodless <i>A Theory of Justice</i>. Here, she draws on aesthetics as well as philosophy to make her point...It&#x2019;s a great book, though, and goes straight on the shelf beside John Rawls. Political morality for the new age. (Brian Morton <i>Glasgow Herald</i> 2013-11-02)<br><br><i>Political Emotions</i> is an important work, and <b>Nussbaum</b> has created valuable space for love and human imperfection to be weighed more heavily in the search for justice. (Geraldine Van Bueren <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2013-11-07)<br><br><b>Nussbaum</b> stimulates readers with challenging insights on the role of emotion in political life. Her provocative theory of social change shows how a truly just society might be realized through the cultivation and studied liberation of emotions, specifically love. To that end, the book sparkles with Nussbaum's characteristic literary analysis, drawing from both Western and South Asian sources, including a deep reading of public monuments. In one especially notable passage, Nussbaum artfully interprets Mozart's <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>, revealing it as a musical meditation on the emotionality of revolutionary politics and feminism. Such chapters are a culmination of her passion for seeing art and literature as philosophical texts, a theme in her writing that she profitably continues here. The elegance with which she negotiates this diverse material deserves special praise, as she expertly takes the reader through analyses of philosophy, opera, primatology, psychology, and poetry. In contrast to thinkers like John Rawls, who imagined an already just world, Nussbaum addresses how to order our society to reach such a world. A plea for recognizing the power of art, symbolism, and enchantment in public life, Nussbaum's cornucopia of ideas effortlessly commands attention and debate.<br> (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i> 2013-08-12)<br><br>Justice is hard. It demands our devotion as well as our understanding. For that reason, it must grip our emotions. We must feel its absence and its presence with the depth of feeling that we associate with love. That is the compelling message in <b>Martha Nussbaum</b>'s remarkable--and remarkably original--account of political emotions. She explores the place of love in a decent society that aspires to be just. And she explains--with great intellectual and emotional force--how we can cultivate a political love with the kind of complexity that does justice to our humanity.<br> (Joshua Cohen, author of <i>The Arc of the Moral Universe and Other Essays</i>)<br><br>In her sweeping panorama of society and culture, <b>Nussbaum</b> skillfully and flexibly uses her understanding of public emotions to produce a book of considerable wisdom and merit. Her study is anchored in a well-rounded view of a complex but largely unexplored theme in the West as well as in South Asia. (Mushirul Hasan, author of <i>Faith and Freedom: Gandhi in History</i>)<br><br><i>Political Emotions</i> is a remarkable synthesis of two of the most distinctive strands of <b>Nussbaum</b>'s thought--a conception of the emotions as essential to our understanding of the world and a political liberalism attuned to the fostering of human capacities. Readers will not fail to be enlightened and moved. (Charles Larmore, author of <i>The Autonomy of Morality</i>)<br><br><b>Martha Nussbaum</b> rises above all the disciplinary boundaries. This wise and engaging study of what patriotism is and how to cultivate it is written by a philosopher, a political theorist, a psychologist, a literary critic, and a historian--all of them at their best and all of them one amazing person.<br> (Michael Walzer, Institute for Advanced Study)<br><br>Reading [<i>Political Emotions</i>] has reinforced, but more importantly broadened, my understanding of love&#x2019;s significance in political life and how it can be fostered there...I find much political wisdom in <b>Nussbaum</b>&#x2019;s book.

Yes, the fact that it measures a good foot and a half might keep it off the average shelf, but its unusual size is not just a gimmick. This book does full-scale justice to the beautiful black-and-white photographs of some of the world's most famous skyscrapers.<p> Organized chronologically, this is not a comprehensive guide but a selective survey: 50 of the most "significant" skyscrapers of the last century. From the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., to the Kuningan Persada Tower in Jakarta, Indonesia, <i>Skyscrapers</i> is a fact lover's dream. Vital statistics on each building include location, height, materials, primary architect, date of completion, and place in architectural history. The careful interaction of text and image brings the unique story of each building--and builder--to life.</p><p> But in both <i>Skyscrapers</i> and her follow-up book, <i>Bridges</i>, Dupr� moves past the structures themselves to examine the ideals and dreams of the society that created them. Why build up? Who initiated the race to be first? The economic, cultural, and political role of buildings in everyday life is easy to overlook. <i>Skyscrapers</i> is a book that sticks out way past the knees and says, "Hey, look again." <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p><i>Skyscrapers</i><p> Rising majestically above the hubbub of crowded cities or standing in stately solitude against a natural backdrop, skyscrapers captivate the eye, excite the imagination, and inspire awe and reverence. Wonders of artistic creativity and engineering ingenuity, of hard work and playful dreaming, they embody the best of our practical achievements and reflect our highest aspirations.</p><p> This magnificent tour presents a fascinating look at fifty of the greatest skyscrapers in the world. Breathtaking photographs capture details often missed by the naked eye; architectural drawings and pictures of works-in-progress take you behind the scenes and enrich your understanding of the efforts involved in erecting many of the buildings; facts-at-a-glance charts give you the vital statistics, including the location of the structure, its height, the primary architect, the date of completion, materials used, and information about its place in architectural history.</p><p> From a church built to the glory of God to monuments that symbolize national or civic pride, to buildings vaunting the material accomplishments of commercial enterprises, <i>Skyscrapers </i>reveals the full story behind the design and construction of each structure. You'll learn about the many social, political, and economic obstacles that delayed the construction of the serenely beautiful Washington Monument; travel to Paris for an intimate look at the Eiffel Tower, the graceful intricate web of prefabricated iron girders that was both touted as proof of French engineering superiority and protested as a threat to individual creative expression; and to Ulm, to behold the filigreed tower and incomparable interior of the great Gothic cathedral, an edifice made possible by the invention of the flying buttress, which freed walls from their load-bearing roles and allowed them to be pierced so that light could flood in.</p><p> You'll encounter such architectural pioneers as William Le Baron Jenney, who took advantage of new technologies like fireproofing, elevators, and electrical lights to create, in 1885, the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, generally acknowledged to be the first skyscraper; Daniel Burnham, who, inspired by the irregular building site, designed New York's Flatiron Building, a dramatic triangular structure that exuberantly mixes Gothic and Renaissance motifs; and Mies van der Rohe, whose elegant, monumental Segram Building epitomizes the ideals of the modernist movement.</p><p> From the ancient pyramids of Egypt to the extraordinary Chrysler Building in New York, an unparalleled melding of art and engineering, every civilization has expressed in buildings both sacred and secular the eternal quest to reach ever upward towards the sky. Skyscrapers invites you to enjoy the stunning works born of that quest. </p></p><h2>Cookie Craft: From Baking to Luster Dust, Designs and Techniques for Creative Cookie Occasions</h2><p>Beautifully decorated cookies are within reach for every home baker, thanks to the easy and practical methods developed by cookie-crafting enthusiasts Valerie Peterson and Janice Fryer.

Traditionally understood as the longest-used tool in human history, with examples dating back more than 2 million years, some handaxes are equally fascinating for their non-utilitarian, aesthetic qualities. First Sculpture will present these objects as evidence of the earliest forms of artistic intention, highlighting the aesthetic qualities of each stone and providing crucial historical and scientific information to give the viewer a deeper understanding of human history, as well as an enriched appreciation for humankind&#39;s early ability to sculpt beautiful objects. The exhibition&#39;s second focus, that of figure stones, suggests early human ability to recognize beauty and meaning in found objects. These naturally occurring stones possess evident shapes and patterns, including geometric forms, animals, and especially faces. Prehistoric people recognized these shapes, and augmented their mimetic qualities through additional carving. First Sculpture: Handaxe to Figure Stone is the product of a unique curatorial collaboration between Los Angeles-based artist Tony Berlant and anthropologist Dr. Thomas Wynn, Distinguished Professor at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. The exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated, scholarly catalogue published by the Nasher, with a central essay co-written by exhibition curators.

Instead of looking out at &#39;them&#39; as dangers or curiosities, Erdrich, drawing on her family&#39;s history, wants to tell about &#39;us&#39;, from the inside. The Birchbark House establishes its own ground, in the vicinity of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s &#39;Little House&#39; books.&#34; --The New York Times Book Review</p><p>Nineteenth-century American pioneer life was introduced to thousands of young readers by Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved <i>Little House</i> books. With <i>The Birchbark House</i>, award-winning author Louise Erdrich's first novel for young readers, this same slice of history is seen through the eyes of the spirited, 7-year-old Ojibwa girl Omakayas, or Little Frog, so named because her first step was a hop. The sole survivor of a smallpox epidemic on Spirit Island, Omakayas, then only a baby girl, was rescued by a fearless woman named Tallow and welcomed into an Ojibwa family on Lake Superior's Madeline Island, the Island of the Golden-Breasted Woodpecker. We follow Omakayas and her adopted family through a cycle of four seasons in 1847, including the winter, when a historically documented outbreak of smallpox overtook the island. <p> Readers will be riveted by the daily life of this Native American family, in which tanning moose hides, picking berries, and scaring crows from the cornfield are as commonplace as encounters with bear cubs and fireside ghost stories. Erdrich--a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwa--spoke to Ojibwa elders about the spirit and significance of Madeline Island, read letters from travelers, and even spent time with her own children on the island, observing their reactions to woods, stones, crayfish, bear, and deer. The author's softly hewn pencil drawings infuse life and authenticity to her poetic, exquisitely wrought narrative. Omakayas is an intense, strong, likable character to whom young readers will fully relate--from her mixed emotions about her siblings, to her discovery of her unique talents, to her devotion to her pet crow Andeg, to her budding understanding of death, life, and her role in the natural world. We look forward to reading more about this brave, intuitive girl--and wholeheartedly welcome Erdrich's future series to the canon of children's classics.

Posner's <i>Law and Literature</i> has handily lived up to the <i>Washington Post's</i> prediction that the book would "remain essential reading for many years to come." This new edition, extensively revised and enlarged, continues to emphasize the essential differences between law and literature, which are rooted in the different social functions of legal and literary texts. But it also explores areas of mutual illumination and expands its range to include new topics such as popular fiction about law, literary education for lawyers, the legal narrative movement, and judicial biography. </p><p> Literary works from classics by Sophocles, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Melville, Kafka, and Camus to contemporary fiction by William Gaddis, Tom Wolfe, and John Grisham come under Posner's scrutiny, as do recent attempts to apply the techniques of literary analysis to statutes, judicial opinions, and the Constitution. In a section entirely new in this edition, Posner discusses the increasing efforts of legal scholars to enrich their scholarship by borrowing the methods and insights of literature--even by insisting that legal education is incomplete without the ethical insights afforded by an immersion in literature. </p><p> Thoroughly rewritten and updated, free of legal and literary jargon, and informed by Posner's extensive erudition and legal experience, this book remains the most clear, acute, and comprehensive account of the intersection of law and literature--"a wonderfully original and instructive study of what literature has to teach us about the law, the methods of legal argument, and the interpretation of statutes and the Constitution" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>). </p></p><p><b>Richard A. Posner</b> is Circuit Judge, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.As Richard Posner reports, the first edition of [this] book is the most frequently assigned or recommended non-fiction work in 'law and literature' classes. Yet he thinks we tend to overrate the connections between the two, and certainly overrate the benefit to lawyers of exposure to literary texts and literary-critical ways of proceeding...His fair-minded presentation of the arguments is a good introduction to many...of the controversies that comprise the field of inquiry. (Anthony Julius, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>An outstanding work, as stimulating as it is intellectually distinguished...Not only are [Posner's] arguments readily grasped, and driven home with an exhilarating forensic skill; in pursuing them, he is also compelled to define his own positions more sharply. (John Gross <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>A book filled with keen judgment, shrewd common sense, and great erudition worn gracefully. Posner's command of his materials--literature, law, and the bodies of commentary and scholarship attached to each--is truly impressive. Still more so is his ability to make the issues vividly clear to the average reader. (Merle Rubin <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br>A wonderfully original and instructive study of what literature has to teach about the law, the methods of legal argument, and the interpretation of statutes and the Constitution...Posner's adversaries are hopelessly outmatched in these arguments, but they are only supporting characters in a larger and more interesting drama--Mr. Posner's own exegesis of the relation of literature to law propounded in a series of arresting, brilliantly interwoven interpretations of dozens of literary works. (Christopher DeMuth <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>The law and literature movement, which is currently gaining momentum on US campuses, argues that lawyers can benefit from studying the literary merits of legal documents and from reading works of literature which deal with law...[The] movement is now courting controversy with suggestions that the Anglo-American legal system is intrinsically biased both sexually and racially. Some proponents claim trials should be radically restructured along narrative, rather than adversarial principles, and that this would allow marginalised voices to be heard. Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the seventh circuit, is sceptical about these arguments. His book is a sensible and forthright introduction to the law and literature movement, which enlightens without blinding.

Reprint.</p><p>New Zealand author Sherryl Jordan has crafted a riveting story, reminiscent of the work of Thomas Hardy, that's shimmering with the romanticism of a fairy tale but told with the vivid detail and suspense of a modern novel. In an ancient time, a newlywed girl is taken to a seaside thatched cottage by her much older husband. His drunken lovemaking repels her, but Marnie must endure because he is the lord's middle son and she has married him to save her family from starvation. When he is killed in a fall, she feels more release than grief, in spite of the village rumors that she caused his death with a witch's curse. Suspicions grow when she befriends an outcast, a "mad" boy called Raver whose rages and yammerings look to villagers like the work of the devil. But Marnie realizes that the boy is deaf, and his bursts of anger come from his inability to communicate. With the help of the kindly and wise village priest, she begins to invent a sign language for him. A tender love grows between them in the cottage, but Marnie still fears the marriage bed. Meanwhile, the scandalized villagers spy on the "witch," and at last force her to endure the bloodcurdling ordeal of trial by hot iron. Readers will gobble up this entrancing story, and may want to move on to Cynthia Voigt's <i>Jackaroo</i>, Michael Cadnum's <i>In a Dark Wood</i>, and perhaps Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i>.

In an age of ferment, following the American and French revolutions, Mary Wollstonecraft took prevailing egalitarian principles and dared to apply them to women. Her book is both a sustained argument for emancipation and an attack on a social and economic system. As Miriam Brody points out in her introduction, subsequent feminists tended to lose sight of her radical objectives. For Mary Wollstonecraft all aspects of women&#39;s existence were interrelated, and any effective reform depended on the redistribution of political and economic power.</p><p>In this passionate reaction to Rousseau&#39;s pedagogical work Emile (1762) Wollstonecraft powerfully defends woman&#39;s ability to reason, given appropriate education. Her radical prescription was for girls to be educated alongside boys and to the same standard. Originally published in 1792, this is a foundational work of feminist political thought.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

The moving end to the tale of the Farseers, in which kingdoms must stand or fall on the beat of a dragon&#39;s wings, or a Fool&#39;s heart. A small and sadly untried coterie -- the old assassin Chade, the serving-boy Thick, Prince Dutiful, and his reluctant Skillmaster, Fitz -- sail towards the distant island of Aslevjal. There they must fulfil the Narcheska&#39;s challenge to her betrothed: to lay the head of the dragon Icefyre, whom legends tell is buried there deep beneath the ice, upon her hearth. Only with the completion of this quest can the marriage proceed, and the resulting alliance signal an end to war between the two kingdoms. It is not a happy ship: tensions between the folk of the Six Duchies and their traditional enemies, the Outislanders, lie just beneath the surface. Thick is constantly ill, and his random but powerful Skilling has taken on a dark and menacing tone, while Chade&#39;s fascination with the Skill is growing to the point of obsession. Having ensured that his beloved friend the Fool is safely left behind in Buckkeep, Fitz is guilt-stricken; but he is determined to keep his fate at bay, since prophecy foretells the Fool&#39;s death if he ever sets foot on the isle of the black dragon. But as their ship draws in towards Aslevjal a lone figure awaits them!</p><p><i>Fool's Fate</i> is the third book of Robin Hobb's Tawny Man trilogy, and the ninth and concluding volume of the Fitzchivalry Farseer saga, one of the best high-fantasy series of the turn of the millennium. Fitz is the bastard son of the royal family of the Six Duchies, which he serves as assassin, guardsman, and Skill-magician. Fitz also serves the White Prophet as "Catalyst," the unique person who may enable the White Prophet to change human destiny for the better. In <i>Fool's Fate</i>, Fitz must accompany his kinsman, Prince Dutiful Farseer, to a distant northern island, where the prince must slay the world's last male dragon to win the hand of the Out Islands princess Elliania, the woman he loves. However, not even Elliania wants the dragon dead; why, then, does she require Dutiful to kill Icefyre? Are darker forces manipulating Elliania? Even worse, if Icefyre dies, the White Prophet foresees not only his own death, but a grim future for humankind. The prophet's only hope of changing the future is his Catalyst. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i>A heralded writer of epic fantasy, Robin Hobb has given readers worlds within worlds in her heroic Farseer and Liveship Traders trilogies.

At 12 young Syms Covington escapes his father's slaughterhouse and England for life at sea. Already six feet tall and bursting with innocence, ambition, and faith, he dreams of glory. But three years later, in 1831, Covington is still only an odd-job boy and ship's fiddler on a barque named after a "beagle-hound." This boat, though, will prove his career salvation, for its cosseted passenger is Charles Darwin. The young naturalist soon marks the sailor out as an adequate aide, a "willing accomplice" to what the grown Covington will later consider "a great murder." By murder he means less the massive plundering of birds and beasts ("stopping the hearts of small life") than the undermining of Biblical truth. If species do in fact evolve, Covington wonders, what proof can there be of God's handiwork? <p> Syms Covington really was Darwin's shooter from 1832 to 1839, and even after he emigrated to Australia, the men continued their tense relationship--until, that is, a copy of <i>The Origin of Species</i> arrived. Though the boy was never the naturalist's "<i>beau ideal</i>" of a collector, still, Roger McDonald writes, </p><blockquote> It was a marriage of convenience they had, and Darwin was like the fianc�e who gives her consent to the match for reasons of suitability but through lack of love rues the intimacy--yet all the time lauding the practicality. </blockquote> If this talented author occasionally lays on the archaisms too heavily, in <i>Mr. Darwin's Shooter</i> he has nonetheless fashioned a sensuous, provocative adventure. <i>--Molly Winterbotham</i>Roger McDonald is one of Australia's most acclaimed novelists, and with Mr. Darwin's Shooter he claims a prominent place in international literature. The story of the manservant described by Charles Darwin's biographer as "the unacknowledged shadow behind every triumph," Mr. Darwin's Shooter is a deeply imagined and stunningly well executed exploration of natural marvels and scientific discovery, masters and servants, ambition and adventure, and, above all, one of history's most significant crises of faith. <p>As a boy, Syms Covington was watched over by the beckoning image of Christian, John Bunyan's pilgrim, in the stained-glass window of his Bedford chapel-and at thirteen he left home and went to sea with the evangelical sailor John Phipps. Phipps' scatechizing could not, however, repress Covington's appetite for life and passage into manhood as he sailed the world, surveying Patagonia and losing his virginity in the Pampas. Aboard the HMS Beagle, he entered Darwin's service, an energetic and precocious fifteen-year-old. In the course of their voyages together over the next seven years, he shot and collected hundreds of specimens for his "gent," specimens that became fundamental to the formulation of Darwin's theory of evolution. </p><p>Now a crusty, near-deaf man of middle age, Covington has settled in Australia and is awaiting the arrival of the first copy of The Origin of Species. Beset by guilt over participating in a work that will shake the human worldview to its foundations, he nonetheless wonders what part of himself might be reflected in Darwin's oeuvre. Mr. Darwin's Shooter captures its time with rare and dazzling skill, evoking an unforgettable-but forgotten-man at a watershed moment in history. </p><p>International Acclaim for Mr. Darwin's Shooter<br> "[An] absorbing novel . . .

"What is here considered," says the author, Elder Bruce R.

The mafia has been given many names since it was founded one hundred and forty years ago: the Sect, the Brotherhood, the Honoured Society, and now Cosa Nostra. Yet as times have changed, the mafia&#39;s subtle and bloody methods have remained the same. Now, for the first time, Cosa Nostra reconstructs the complete history of the Sicilian mafia from its origins to the present day, from the lemon groves and sulphur mines of Sicily, to the streets of Manhattan. Cosa Nostra is a definitive history, rich in atmosphere, and with the narrative pace of the best detective fiction. The mob genre has finally grown up.</p><p>The Italian-American mafia has its roots in a mysterious and powerful criminal network in Sicily. While the mythology of the mafia has been widely celebrated in American culture, the true origins of its rituals, laws, and methods have never actually been revealed. John Dickie uses startling new research to expose the secrets of the Sicilian mafia, providing a fascinating account that is more violent, frightening, and darkly comic than anything conceived in popular movies and novels. How did the Sicilian mafia begin? How did it achieve its powerful grip in Italy and America? How does it operate today? From the mafia's origins in the 1860s to its current tense relationship with the Berlusconi government, <i>Cosa Nostra</i> takes us to the inner sanctum where few have dared to go before. This is an important work of history and a revelation for anyone who ever wondered what it means to be "made" in the mob.<br>John Dickie is both an academic cultural historian and an advertising copywriter and researcher for several major international companies.

Translated by Tim Parks. Illustrated. 403 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $25. THERE were no mythology books in fifth-century Athens. Everyone knew the stories. Boys were taught to recite Homer&#39;s accounts of Achilles&#39; anger and the return of Odysseus, and other epic poems recounted the myths of the love affairs of the gods and the adventures of the famous heroes. Myths were related to women working at their looms, and male citizens could watch how the dramatists would tell the same stories in new and exciting ways. But after the mid-fourth century, when King Philip of Macedon defeated Athens, and his son Alexander, through his conquests, spread Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean area, the first Greek mythology books were written for the many people who did not know the stories. Perhaps the most influential surviving example of this genre is the epic &#34;Metamorphoses&#34; or &#34;Transformations,&#34; by the Roman poet Ovid, which recounts in Latin verse how certain mortals were turned into animals or plants as a result of their encounters with the gods.</p><p>Already an international literary event, and translated into a dozen languages, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony is a book without any modern parallel. Forming an active link in a chain that reaches back through Ovid&#39;s Metamorphoses directly to Homer, Roberto Calasso&#39;s reexploration of the fantastic fables we may think we know explodes the entire world of Greek mythology, pieces it back together as it once must have been, and presents it to us in a new astonishing, and utterly contemporary way. &#34;But how did it all begin?&#34; The eternal question that Man has always asked of his universe also forms the opening words of this book. In answer, and in the voice of the born story-teller (all erudition, all interpretation is hidden in the folds of his dazzling narrative), Calasso leads us through the maze, back to the time when the gods were not yet born from the original coupling of Uranus and Ge, Mother Earth; then forward again, all the way to the death of Odysseus, which marks the end of the age of heroes; and - most important of all - to the marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, the last occasion when the gods sat down at a feast with mortal men. That day began a chain of calamities, a streak of blood that parted earth from Olympus forever. What was left - Cadmus&#39;s parting gift to men - was the alphabet, and from it both history and poetry, and so our world, were born. Yet the world of myth is not dead - it is present now as it was in the time of Homer. The most dangerous event since the beginning of time has been the gods&#39; discovery of us, their Olympian fascination with these human creatures that led them first to invade our world, then to assume human form for their own purposes and their ownterrible games. The consequences of that fascination are the extraordinary encounters that we know as the myths - the great, hypnotic, erotic, often contradictory stories that Calasso walks us back into as if they are some vast, half-ruined palace we had forgotten we owned. At the end, the gods abandoned the world. But the multifaceted psychology of modern man and his atemporal sense of time have brought him closer than ever to the mythic condition. And as the author reminds us, the gods - now as then - do not ask to be believed; they ask only to be recognized. &#34;These things never happened, but they are always&#34;. Roberto Calasso&#39;s book transforms our relationship to the wellsprings of our culture.Presenting the stories of Zeus and Europa, Theseus and Ariadne, the birth of Athens and the fall of Troy, in all their variants, Calasso also uncovers the distant origins of secrets and tragedy, virginity, and rape. &#34;A perfect work like no other. (Calasso) has re-created . . . the morning of our world.&#34;--Gore Vidal. 15 engravings.</p><h2>Katy Grannan: Model American</h2><p>Working with ordinary people who answered ads in local papers, posing them in their nondescript homes or unexceptional landscapes and using relatively simple equipment, Katy Grannan alchemizes these factors into extraordinary photographs. Disarming for their directness and for the provocative but casual nudity on display, her pictures capture the spirit of her subjects in the manner of Diane Arbus, but they also draw upon the artificial, posed tableaux of Gregory Crewdson and, indeed, art history. The posture of the tattooed and tanned (and nude) figure in &#34;Mike,&#34; a 2003 portrait which appeared in the 2004 Whitney Biennial, resembles nothing so much as the awkward repose of the desert nomad in Henri Rousseau&#39;s &#34;Sleeping Gypsy.&#34; In this first monograph, over half of the photographs are previously unpublished, providing a fresh depth to our understanding of this already widely known and accomplished young artist. Sitting on a dirt road in a knit bikini, standing defiantly in a corner of a cheaply paneled living room, leaning languidly against a chain-link fence, Grannan&#39;s photoraphs convey the dark side that we all have as well as the need to be recognized as unique individuals.</p><p>Katy Grannan was born in Arlington, Massachusetts, in 1969. She received her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 1991 and her M.F.A. from Yale University in 1999. Her work has been featured in multiple group exhibitions; she was one of five photographers selected for the 2004 Whitney Biennial. Solo exhibitions of Grannan&#x2019;s work have been held at Lawrence Rubin Greenberg Van Doren Fine Art in New York (2000 and 2003) and other galleries. She recently received the 2004 Baum Award for Emerging American Photographers, the Theater Gallery of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (2004). Grannan is represented by the Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, New York. She lives in New York City and San Francisco.Starred Review. Posed with an apparently deliberate awkwardness in living rooms and bedrooms, by rural roads and in the woods, the models in Grannan's photographs stare out with uniformly expressionless faces. But, unlike the photos for fashion magazines that Grannan also occasionally shoots, the subjects of these 75 portraits are no stylishly empty ciphers. Instead, the photographs, charged as they are with an underlying current of mystery, dramatize the unbridgeable gap between subject and observer. In the first half of the book, which covers roughly the period from 1998 to 2003, Grannan's photos are shot inside the houses of her subjects, and taken using only the most basic equipment. With a fetishistic fixation on cheap, retro interiors, these photos flirt with a porn chic look and are, at times, in danger of being suffocated by their own knowingness. When Grannan takes her photo shoots outdoors, in the more recent work that forms the book's second half, something extraordinary happens. Grannan's purposely stagey images come alive with a weird, hard-edged lyricism when shot in natural light, with a backdrop of soil, foliage, and water. There may be other artists working in the post&#x2013;Cindy Sherman vein of photography that calls attention to its own theatricality (among them, Malerie Marder), but Grannan has found a thorny beauty all her own. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An informative authorized biography and a critique of Porter's work, this lavishly illustrated monograph makes a case for Porter as a major American artist comparable to Pierre Bonnard in his subjective receptivity to people and events, a painter who caught the essence of each moment and never repeated himself. Spike, a specialist in Italian art, gives full consideration to Porter's gritty cityscapes of the 1930s, when he dabbled in radical political causes. From his friend Willem de Kooning, Porter learned to paint quickly and fearlessly, and from Bonnard and Vuillard, he was guided on his artistic course. Porter's airy, light-filled landscapes, interiors, portraits and crystalline ocean views are reproduced here in 280 plates, most of them in color. <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Harcourt School Publishers Science: Student Edition Grade 1 2000</h2><p>You&#39;ll be wild about HSP Science!

Our scouts were out left flank and right flank, while Pitt Mackeson and me formed the point. The night had been long and arduous, the horses were lathered to the withers and dust was caking mud to our jackets. We had been aided through the night by busthead whiskey and our breaths blasphemed the scent of early morning spring. Blossoms had begun a cautious bloom on dogwood trees, and grass broke beneath hooves to impart rich, green odor. The Sni-A-Bar flowed to the west, a slight creek more than a river, but a comfort to tongues dried gamy and horses hard rode. We were making our way down the slope to it, through a copse of hickory trees full of housewife squirrels gossiping at our passing, when we saw a wagon halted near the stream. </p><p> There was a man holding a hat for his hitched team to drink from, and a woman, a girl in red flannel and a boy who was splashing about at the water's edge, raising mud. The man's voice boomed to scold the boy for this, as he had yet to drink. The language of his bark put him in peril. </p><p> "Dutchman," Mackeson said, then spit. "Goddamn lop-eared St. Louis Dutchman." Mackeson was American and had no use for foreigners, and only a little for me. He had eyes that were not set level in his hatchet face, so that he saw you top and bottom in one glance. I watched him close when crowds of guns were banging, and kept him to my front. </p><p> "Let us bring Black John up," I said. </p><p> I turned in my saddle and raised my right hand above me, waved a circle with it, then pointed ahead. The main group was trailing us by some distance, so we had to pause while Black John brought the boys up. When they were abreast of us the files parted and Black John took one column of blue to the right, and Coleman Younger took the other to the left. </p><p> This movement caused some noise. The Dutchman was made alert by the rumble of hooves but had no chance to escape us. We tightened our circle about the wagon, made certain the family was alone, then dismounted. </p><p> The family crusted around the Dutchman, not in fear, but to introduce themselves. Our uniforms were a relief to them, for they did not look closely at our mismatched trousers and our hats that had rebel locks trailing below them. This was a common mistake and we took pleasure in prompting it. </p><p> Most of the boys couldn't be excited by a single man, so they led their mounts to the stream, renewed their friendship with whiskey and generally tomfooled about near the water. Black John Ambrose, Mackeson, me and a few others confronted the Dutchman. He offered his hand to Black John, whose stiff height, bristly black curls and hard-set face made his leadership plain. </p><p> "Wilhelm Schnellenberger," the Dutchman said. </p><p> Black John did not extend his own hand, but spit, as Americans are wont to do when confident of their might. </p><p> "Are you secesh?" Black John asked, ever so coaxingly. "Are you southern man?" </p><p> <i>"Nein,"</i> the Dutchman responded. He gradually dropped his hand back to his side. "No secesh. Union man." </p><p> I spit, then pawed the glob with my boot. </p><p> "Dutchman," Mackeson said. "Lop-eared Dutchman." </p><p> "Are you certain you are not at all secesh?" Black John asked once more, his lips split in a manner that might be a grin. </p><p> "No, no, no," the apple-headed Dutchman answered. His baffled immigrant eyes wandered among us. He smiled. "No secesh. No secesh. Union man." </p><p> The woman, the girl and the boy nodded in agreement, the boy beginning to study our uniforms. He was about four years younger than me and looked to be a smart sprout despite his snubbed nose and loose jaw. I kept a watch on him. </p><p> Black John pursed his lips and poised to speak, like a preacher caught breathless between the good news and the bad. </p><p> Some of the fellows were in the shallows kicking a stick to and fro, trying to keep it in the air, whiskey to the winner. It was a poetry moment: water, whiskey, no danger, a friendly sun in the sky, larks and laughter. </p><p> "Aw, hell," Black John said. "Stretch his neck. And be sharp about it." </p><p> The woman had some American, and the Dutchman had enough anyway, for when she flung her arms about him wailing, he sunk to his knees. His head lolled back on his neck and his face went white. He began mumbling about his god, and I was thinking how his god must've missed the boat from Hamburg, for he was not near handy enough to be of use in this land. </p><p> Mackeson goaded me. "What's he babblin'?" </p><p> "He is praying to Abe Lincoln," I answered. </p><p> A rope was needed. Coleman Younger had a good one but would not lend it as it was new, so we used mine. Mackeson formed it into a noose with seven coils rather than thirteen, for he had no inclination to bring bad luck onto himself. Thirteen is proper, though, and some things ought to be done right. I raised this issue. </p><p> "You do it then, Dutchy," Mackeson said, tossing the seven-coiled rope to me. "Bad luck'll not change your course anyhow." </p><p> The rope burned between my fingers as I worked to make the Dutchman's end a proper one. The situation had sunk in on the family and they had become dull. The Dutchman saw something in me and began to speak. He leaned toward me and wiggle-waggled in that alien tongue of ours. I acted put upon by having thus to illustrate my skill in oddball dialects, lest I be watched for signs of pride in the use of my parents' language. </p><p> "We care nothing for the war," the Dutchman said. He had lost his hysterics for the moment and seemed nearly sensible. I respected that, but fitted the noose with thirteen coils around his neck. "We are for Utah Territory. Utah. This is not a war in Utah, we learn." </p><p> "This war is everywhere," I said. </p><p> "I am no Negro-stealer. I am barrel maker." </p><p> "You are Union." </p><p> <i>"Nein.</i> I am for Utah Territory." </p><p> I gave the long end of the rope to Mackeson, as I knew he wanted it. He threw it high up over a cottonwood branch, then tied it to the trunk. </p><p> Jack Bull Chiles was standing between Mackeson and the water; and as he was my near brother, raised on the same bit of earth, he hustled the Dutchman toward the wagon for me. Some of the other boys joined him, and they lifted the center of attention to the seat of the wagon, startling the team, and setting off screeches of metal on wood, mules and women. </p><p> I stepped back from the wagon's path, then turned to Black John. </p><p> "He says he is not a Union man," I told him. I was flat with my voice, giving the comment no more weight than a remark on the weather. "He was codded by our costumes." </p><p> "Sure he says that," Mackeson said. "Dutchman don't mean 'fool.'" </p><p> "Now he says he is sympathetic to our cause, does he?" Black John said. He was remounted and others were following suit. "Well, he should've hung by his extractions rather than live by the lie." Black John swelled himself with a heavy breath, then nodded to Mackeson. "He's just a goddamn Dutchman anyhow, and I don't much care." </p><p> Mackeson winked meanly at Schnellenberger, then stepped past him and slapped the mules on the rump. </p><p> The immigrant swung, and not summer-evening peaceful, but frantic. </p><p> "One less Dutchman," Coleman Younger said. </p><p> They all watched me, as they always did when wronghearted Dutchmen were converted by us. They were watching me even as they faced away, or giggled. Such an audience compelled me to act, so I mounted my big bay slowly, elaborately cool about the affair. </p><p> The woman was grieved beyond utterance, her eyes wide and her mouth open and trembling, as if she would scream but could not. The little girl was curled in behind <i>Mutter's</i> big skirts, whimpering. </p><p> The boy I watched, as I'd pegged him for smart. With his hands hanging limp at his sides he walked beneath his father's dancing boots, then gave a cry and made a move to loosen the rope about the cottonwood trunk.</p></p><h2>Ride Smart: Improve Your Horsemanship Skills on the Ground and in the Saddle</h2><p>Under one title, Craig Cameron brings together a thorough look at horses and their nature and good, solid horsemanship skills that suit both novice and experienced riders.

From the outside, the cathedral town of Lafferton seems idyllic, but in many ways it is just like any other place. It suffers from the same kinds of crime, is subject to the same pressures from a rapidly changing world, and has the same hopes and fears as any number of towns up and down the land. When Simon Serrailler is called in by Lafferton&#x2019;s new Chief Constable, Kieran Bright, he is met by two plainclothes officers, who ask him to take the principal role in a difficult, potentially dangerous undercover operation. He must leave town immediately, without telling anyone&#x2015;not even his girlfriend Rachel, who has only just moved in with him. Meanwhile, Simon's sister Cat is facing difficult choices at work, as Lafferton&#x2019;s hospice closes its bedded units&#x2015;and at home, as her daughter is presented with a glittering opportunity that they would have to struggle to afford. And all is not well with Simon and Cat's stepmother, Judith, either. To complete his special operation, Simon must inhabit the mind of the worst kind of criminal. This takes its toll on Simon and&#x2015;as the investigation unfolds&#x2015;also on the town and some of its most respected citizens.</p><p><b>Susan Hill</b>&#x2019;s novels and short stories have won the Whitbread Book, Somerset Maugham, and John Llewellyn Rhys Awards and the <i>Yorkshire Post </i>Book of the Year and have been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.

After a week of frosts, the wind had swung to the west, bringing milder air. Snowdrops and crocuses were over, daffodils were flowering. Quiet, empty streets. No footsteps.</p><p>Jeff Barclay and Robbie Freeman sat on a low wall near the bus stop in the square, finishing off a shared kebab. They only had enough money for one, and a tea. Robbie screwed up the greasy paper and lifted his arm to throw it into a nearby bin. But his arm froze in mid-air.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Bloody hell.&#x2019;</p><p><i>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</i> Jeff shoved him so that he almost fell off the wall. Robbie did not protest or shove back, he just stared at the entrance to the Lanes, the cobbled pedestrian-only street to their left.</p><p>&#x2018;Shit, did you see that?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Didn&#x2019;t see anything. What was it &#x2013; a ghost?&#x2019; Jeff snorted.</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019; Robbie said quietly, getting off the wall and walking towards the Lanes. &#x2018;I saw a kid.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What sort of kid?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A little kid. It ... it had no clothes on.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re taking the piss. I never saw any naked kid.&#x2019;</p><p>Jeff levelled with him as they reached the top of the Lanes. There were old-fashioned lamps at either end and a couple of shops had lighted front windows. The whole street was empty.</p><p>&#x2018;Stupid.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No. I saw it. There was a little kid, it sort of &#x2013; just ran and then it vanished.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, right. Come on, let&#x2019;s see if there&#x2019;s anyone outside the Magpie.&#x2019;</p><p>But Robbie was walking slowly away from him, looking closely to right and left. In the end, Jeff followed.</p><p>&#x2018;How could there be a kid?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I know what I saw.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What are you on, Rob? You start seeing things, you got a problem.&#x2019;</p><p>There was a passageway between the deli and a smart clothes shop, and as Robbie looked into it, he saw a quick movement &#x2013; something pale. He ran down, but he had to push past two wheelie bins, and by the time he had got through, if there had been anyone, they&#x2019;d gone.</p><p>&#x2018;Cat.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re mad.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, for fuck&#x2019;s sake! I&#x2019;m off home.&#x2019;</p><p>It was another five minutes before Robbie followed him. They walked slowly along the kerb, thumbs out every time a vehicle went by. Not many did.</p><p>&#x2018;Wanker.&#x2019; Jeff gave two fingers to a speeding car. Robbie said nothing. His head was full of what he knew he had seen &#x2013; not imagined, not hallucinated, seen. A child, maybe three or four years old, naked, slithering out of sight into the shadows, dodging down the alley and passageway. He couldn&#x2019;t get it out of his mind.</p><p>A patrol car took the call at twenty to three.</p><p>PC Bev Willet sighed. &#x2018;Wind-up,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>&#x2018;Sounds like it. But just in case &#x2013; hold onto your hat.&#x2019;</p><p>It had been a quiet night. Even a wind-up was better than trying to keep awake with more plastic coffee. The car raced up the bypass.</p><p>&#x2018;How old did he say?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Little kid, three or so. Couldn&#x2019;t say if it was a boy or girl.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And <i>naked</i>?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Naked.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;They piss me off, these hoaxers. I&#x2019;d have them dunked in the canal on a freezing night.&#x2019; Bev snorted as she pulled up at the entrance to the Lanes. One taxi was in the rank, the driver asleep with a copy of the <i>Sun</i> over his face. He didn&#x2019;t stir at the sound of the patrol car.</p><p>&#x2018;Talk to him in a mo. Come on.&#x2019;</p><p>Ten minutes later they had scoured the area, including every alley and passageway, every wheelie bin and recycling area.</p><p>&#x2018;Diddly squat,&#x2019; Bev said.</p><p>&#x2018;Pisses me off, this sort of thing.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You said.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Only why would he invent <i>a naked child</i>, for heaven&#x2019;s sake?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Guaranteed to make us move fast.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Right. Just someone&#x2019;s idea of a good laugh then. Better go and wake up our cabby.&#x2019;</p><p>But their cabby had been out on jobs all evening and then fallen asleep. He was going home now. He&#x2019;d keep an eye out.</p><p>&#x2018;His face said it all.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Wind-up.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Wind-up.&#x2019;</p><p>Jess Honeywell&#x2019;s baby woke for a feed at four. She picked him up out of his crib and moved the curtain aside briefly to look out at the night. Starry, with a big moon. A front-bedroom light was on a few doors down. Another wakeful baby. She and Katie Green sometimes chanced to look out at the same time and then they&#x2019;d wave, sharing the small hours of new babies. They had propped one another up through pregnancy and the first weeks and went on doing so now, meeting almost every day, walking their buggies together, swapping notes. It had made all the difference. St Luke&#x2019;s Road was in the grid of small Victorian terraced houses known as the Apostles, friendly, neighbourly, and near to the shops, coffee bars and restaurants of Lafferton&#x2019;s centre. They were lucky, Jess thought as she dropped the curtain, even if the houses were small. She hated the idea of being stuck out in the sticks, even with bigger rooms and a garden, but no life nearby and needing a car to get you anywhere. They couldn&#x2019;t afford a car. Matt walked to work.</p><p>The Green bedroom was in darkness, the moon shining on quiet pavements, but as she turned, Jess thought she saw something move. Turned back and lifted the curtain again. No. Trick of the light. Nothing. And then her hand went to her mouth. Noah was grizzling himself back to sleep but she barely noticed.</p><p>Matt was hard to wake and when he did, he stumbled out of bed assuming he had to pick up the baby and was almost able to do so in his sleep.</p><p>He came awake fully as Jess shook his arm.</p><p>&#x2018;What? You&#x2019;ve been dreaming &#x2013;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;NO. Matt, go down, go out there ... I was not dreaming. You&#x2019;ve got to go.&#x2019; Noah cried again as her voice rose. She picked him up and sat on the edge of the bed, putting him to the breast and gesturing to Matt to hurry.</p><p>It was not that he refused to believe her, just that he was still not fully awake, and he felt foolish, standing half dressed and in slippers, looking up and down St Luke&#x2019;s Road and seeing nothing, Nothing at all. But she had been wide awake and he knew that she thought she had seen ...</p><p>And then he saw.</p><p>The child was squatting down behind the gate of a house opposite.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s OK,&#x2019; Matt said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right, it&#x2019;s all right.&#x2019;</p><p>He went through the gate and stopped. Later, he said that he would never forget the child&#x2019;s face until his dying day. Later, he could not sleep because the face was in front of him. Later, he was haunted during his waking hours by sudden flashbacks to the child&#x2019;s face as it looked up at him.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right. Dear God. Listen, I won&#x2019;t hurt you. I&#x2019;m going to look after you, OK?&#x2019; But even as he spoke, gently, quietly, the child tried to shrink into a hedge, as if it might find a safe place among the rough bare twigs and earth.</p><p>Very slowly, Matt inched his way, his hand out, talking softly in what he desperately hoped was a voice of reassurance. The child continued to shrink from him and now it turned its face away from him out of fear.</p><p>It was a girl. She was perhaps four years old. She was filthy, she had smears of blood on her arms and legs. Her long, fine, fair hair was matted to her scalp. She was completely naked.</p><p>There was silence and stillness and fear for long minutes before the child lurched forward, the hedge catching at her again as she moved and drawing fresh pinpoints of blood, and then she was clinging to Matt, climbing up him like a terrified small animal and pressing her little body to him. He put his arm round her carefully and edged backwards down the path. She did not move, only clung fast to him. Matt hurried across the road, back into the house, calling to Jess. But she had already seen him through the window and only seconds later, blue lights turning, the police car stopped outside.</p><p><i>Two</i></p><p>MAY 2007</p><p>Year 2 at St Luke&#x2019;s Primary School had been talking about Things I Like and Things I Don&#x2019;t Like, as part of the week&#x2019;s topic on food and drink. Sue Norwood had found it informative. Most of the likes were as expected &#x2013; sweet things, crisps, sometimes the odd grape &#x2013; and the dislikes she could have predicted &#x2013; milk, green vegetables, stew, runny egg. The next part of the topic would be more challenging &#x2013; why we should try the things we don&#x2019;t like again, in case we find we do like them after all. Why we shouldn&#x2019;t eat too many sweets, even if we like them very much. Why our bodies need a variety of foods, including green vegetables ... they would dutifully chant the &#x2018;dislikes&#x2019; list and promise to try them again, go home and forget all about it. They would still come to school each morning carrying a half-empty pack of sticky sweets and an egg would never pass their lips. Some of them had even picked up on the words &#x2018;wheat&#x2019; and &#x2018;dairy&#x2019; in the same breath as the words &#x2018;allergy&#x2019; and &#x2018;intolerance&#x2019;.</p><p>But they were still one of the best classes she had ever taught, alert, funny, loyal to one another and relatively well behaved. One or two had problems, including the boy who still wore nappies and the girl who never spoke, problems which were not easy to solve, and ought to involve the parents.</p><p>Sue sighed. She knew that the parents of the boy who still wore nappies would never come through the school gates, let alone come to see her.</p><p>The silent child was sitting at the far end of the second table now, head bent to the paper so that her face was barely visible. Glory Dorfner. There were some colourful names in Years 1 and 2 but what parent called their child &#x2018;Glory&#x2019;? And why not? she asked herself smartly. Better than ... well, better than quite a few.</p><p>The classroom was quiet, apart from the odd sniff, cough and shuffle. They were drawing and labelling with some glee six things they disliked to eat or drink. She stood behind Alfie Starman. His ears needed a wash, but his careful picture of a cabbage was very good indeed and she said so. Alfie glanced round, flushed with pride and pleasure. Rikki O&#x2019;Mara kicked him in the shin. But, as Rikki would have said, if challenged, &#x2018;in a good way, Mrs Norwood&#x2019;. She had a soft spot for Rikki.</p><p>Glory bent her head even further and her arm was curved across the paper to hide it. Sue waited a moment. She could feel the child&#x2019;s tension.</p><p>&#x2018;May I see?&#x2019;</p><p>Glory shook her head slightly.</p><p>&#x2018;Shall I guess?&#x2019;</p><p>The child was absolutely still.</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t like &#x2013; chips?&#x2019; Shouts from all sides, arms waving. Everyone liked chips. &#x2018;All right, I know. Chip pictures, all of you.&#x2019;</p><p>Much giggling.</p><p>&#x2018;But maybe Glory doesn&#x2019;t like chips.&#x2019;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x2018;I think you don&#x2019;t like &#x2013; tea?&#x2019;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x2018;Tomatoes?&#x2019;</p><p>Sue did not continue. She waited a moment, went round three others, looking, admiring, querying. Then got a spare low chair and sat next to Glory. But the child was immovable. She said nothing. Would not lift her arm.</p><p>It was early evening before she finally opened the big folder containing Year 2&#x2019;s work, setting the pile on the table next to a box of gold paper stars. Alice was marking Year 12 English essays, swearing from time to time.</p><p>&#x2018;OFFS, Damian Cross, try reading the text.&#x2019;</p><p>Sue smiled, and turned over the next sheet.</p><p>For a second, she thought it had ended up in her folder by mistake, except that she could not possibly imagine how.</p><p>Glory could barely write and what she did manage was still in mirror-writing. Well, that would sort itself out, it always did.</p><p>&#x2018;<i>I don&#x2019;t like</i> ...&#x2019; was in smudged dark pastel, large letters copied in almost violently.</p><p>Sue felt her face flush as she looked at the drawing.</p><p>Then she called Alice over.</p><p>&#x2018;Police,&#x2019; Alice said almost immediately.</p><p>&#x2018;What on earth can they do?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Or family welfare officers ... NSPCC? I don&#x2019;t know, but you&#x2019;ve got to show this to someone.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Maybe Glory&#x2019;s parents ...&#x2019;</p><p>Alice gave her a look.</p><p>&#x2018;No, you&#x2019;re right.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Take it to Eleanor first thing, cover your back. Let her decide.&#x2019;</p><p>Alice went back to the essays on <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, muttering as usual about wishing they could read a more challenging novel, vowing yet again to start them on <i>Great Expectations</i> the moment they were done with the set text.</p><p>Glory&#x2019;s picture seemed to come in front of every one of the others that she looked at.

Lionized in his lifetime, he is best remembered today for several staples of the concert hall and for such popular music as "The Wedding March" and "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing."<br> Now, in the first major Mendelssohn biography to appear in decades, R. Larry Todd offers a remarkably fresh account of this musical giant, based upon painstaking research in autograph manuscripts, correspondence, diaries, and paintings. Rejecting the view of the composer as a craftsman of felicitous but sentimental, saccharine works (termed by one critic "moonlight with sugar water"), Todd reexamines the composer's entire oeuvre, including many unpublished and little known works. Here are engaging analyses of Mendelssohn's distinctive masterpieces--the zestful Octet, puckish <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, haunting <em>Hebrides</em> Overtures, and elegiac Violin Concerto in E minor. Todd describes how the composer excelled in understatement and nuance, in subtle, coloristic orchestrations that lent his scores an undeniable freshness and vividness. He also explores Mendelssohn's changing awareness of his religious heritage, Wagner's virulent anti-Semitic attack on Mendelssohn's music, the composer's complex relationship with his sister Fanny Hensel, herself a child prodigy and prolific composer, his avocation as a painter and draughtsman, and his remarkable, polylingual correspondence with the cultural elite of his time. <br> <em>Mendelssohn: A Life</em> offers a masterful blend of biography and musical analysis. Readers will discover many new facets of the familiar but misunderstood composer and gain new perspectives on one of the most formidable musical geniuses of all time.</p><p><br><strong>R. Larry Todd</strong> was hailed in <em>The New York Times</em> as "the dean of Mendelssohn scholars in the United States." A Professor of Musicology at Duke University, he has published widely on Mendelssohn and his time, and nineteenth-century music.<br><br>"Todd's monumental and magisterial biography is itself a celebration of the composer's life and achievement.... Such an exhaustive and definitive biography as Mr. Todd's 'Mendelssohn' will surely become a standard reference work for many years to come."--<em>Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"A highly readable and authoritative account of a brief but remarkably creative life, and an important contribution to Mendelssohn studies."--Hugh Canning, <em>Sunday Times</em> (London)<p></p><br>"At long last a great, elegant, and monumental biography. It will take its rightful place as the standard and indispensable guide to Mendelssohn's life and music with a sensitive understanding of the complex historical currents and contexts surrounding the composer. Based on exemplary research this book should put to rest the cliches and injustices that have plagued a great composer's work and reputation. A stunning achievement. A landmark in scholarship and writing on the history of music."--Leon Botstein, President, Bard College, Editor of <em>The Musical Quarterly</em>, and Music Director of The American Symphony Orchestra<p></p><br>"Magisterial, exhaustively documented book likely to become the standard biography.... Throughout, Todd interweaves his subject's biographical journey with his performing and compositional activities on an almost daily schedule, exploring in-depth his studies of and dealings with the vagaries of music publishing, conducting assignments, championing of the works of earlier masters such as Bach, and relations with other musicians. The author's musical analysis is clear to the layperson yet includes enough specifics to be useful to serious musicians, while his literate style helps to create an organic whole."--<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"A valuable book for those who like a graceful biography, and those who are curious about composers beyond the familiar 'Three Bs.'"--<em>Seattle Times</em><p></p><br>"So full and frantic was the short life of the 'Mozart of the nineteenth century' it would make breathless reading in lesser hands than Professor Todd's. Here not only the music but the pressures of life that created it, the constant travel, the correspondence with friends and family, the witty asides, and even a synoptic and sympathetic view of critical opinion on his main works from his own time until the present day are digested within this much-needed survey, and presented with accuracy, intelligence and insight. A Bible for Mendelssohn's growing and hungry supporters!" --Christopher Hogwood, Honorary Professor of Music, Cambridge University<p></p><br>"R. Larry Todd makes a fine contribution to biography and to 19th-century music history in this detailed survey of Mendelssohn's life. From this book we get not just a new portrait of Mendelssohn as man and artist, but valuable perspectives on his celebrated family, on religious and social issues in Germany in his time, on his contemporaries, and on the state of music in the Biedermeier and early Victorian worlds. Through this study of a single, immensely gifted musician Todd outlines important trends in musical style in the Romantic era, both those that Mendelssohn inherited and those to which he made lasting contributions, from the miraculous Octet written at age sixteen to the Violin Concerto and the late oratorios."--Lewis Lockwood, author of <em>Beethoven: The Music and the Life</em><p></p><br></p><h2>A Treasury of Little golden books: 30 best-loved stories</h2><p>A selection of thirty stories and poems, each with their original illustrations, previously published as separate editions of Little Golden Books.</p><p></p><h2>Who Is to Blame?: A Novel in Two Parts</h2><p><p>"Herzen's novel played a significant part in the intellectual ferment of the 1840s.

She was the mother of two sons and had a successful career as a nationally known advocate for fertility issues. But she felt a growing sexual restlessness and yearning that wouldn't let up. And though Pamela loved her husband and didn't want to have an affair, she knew deep down that she needed more, much more.

Earthquakes, for instance. Plates deep beneath the surface move, shift, bump, and grind for eons. All that subterranean action sends up warning tremors, little rumbles that are often too small to notice. Until the big one hits, the one that shatters windows, brings down buildings, and snaps bridges in two.<br><br>I am an earthquake.<br><br>The first obvious tremblers hit when I corralled my Martini Gang--my sister, my cousin on my mother's side, and my two best girlfriends--into an "authentic" Korean spa for a day of tubs, scrubs, and hot-crystal meditation rooms. I'd read about it in the New York Times months before. It sounded fabulous. Wrangling all of us into the same place at the same time, however, was not so fabulous. It required weeks of intense negotiations. I got less agitated bringing a nonprofit staff and a board of directors into agreement on a radical new fertility policy than I got pulling five of us together. Even for a self-made, headstrong executive director like me, nothing's harder than coordinating type-A women who are overextended with work, children, and some version of a marriage. Especially when it involves them abandoning their homesteads early on a summer Sunday for exotic indulgences beyond the Manhattan city limits in Fort Lee, New Jersey.<br><br>Beth was the special challenge. Her life had more moving parts than a pinball machine. I knew she had to wrestle with her volatile brood of four adolescent girls, the dog, the garden, the twenty-year marriage, and, of course, the boyfriend. She ran a small, well-curated art gallery and indiscriminately served on do-gooder committees. The two E's were her constants: Erratic schedules and Emergencies.<br><br>I maneuvered into a parking space next to Beth's eco-friendly hybrid. She had arrived seconds before me and was leaning against her car, long black hair blowing in the Sahara-like wind, deep in an animated phone conversation. Two minutes later, Vicki--my big sister--pulled in behind me. She had Cousin Sophia, my own personal Italian-Jewish Auntie Mame, in tow. Vicki locked up and they walked over, Sophia carrying off the billowy chiffon top that hid her lovely roundness and made her seem much younger than her sixty-plus years.<br><br>"Husband or Kevin?" Vicki asked, raising an artfully shaped eyebrow.<br><br>Beth snapped the cell phone shut. Her flushed cheeks were a dead giveaway. I knew that look. I knew everything about her since we were five years old and our mothers made us hold hands the first time we went ice-skating. We haven't let go since. Beth put on oversized shades to hide her obviously teary brown eyes. Loverland isn't always easy.<br><br>"Kevin," Vicki and I chorused softly.<br><br>"Did you tell Mom what we were doing today?" I asked Vicki while we waited for Beth to compose herself.<br><br>"Absolutely not!" Vicki was vehement.<br><br>"So neither one of us checked in. . . . That's going to go over really well."<br><br>"I coulda been lyin' dead on the floor for all anyone would know. What would it take? One phone call?" Vicki's Mom schtick was dead-on. She was a carbon copy of our mother, right down to the curve of her long, shapely legs.<br><br>We burst out laughing.<br><br>"Just the idea of your tennis-playing, step-dancing, aquasizing eighty-year- old mother helpless anywhere is just too funny. Aunt Roz would love to be here, a day with the girls," Sophia said.<br><br>"Ooh, that would have been perfect. Why didn't I think of that?" I said, my conscience kicking in. "Damn it. I'll call her on the way home and take the hit."<br><br>Beth waved her hand to get our attention, as if we weren't standing an unobstructed five feet away. She craned her neck, scouring the crowd. "Let me guess, Olivia's not here yet."<br><br>We loitered in the sticky tar parking lot, pale Amazons in a sea of tiny Korean women all headed for the King Spa. Olivia was always punctually ten minutes late. Her computer went down. Her genius twin boys were one chemical com�d away from a patentable cure for carbohydrate cravings. Her petulance-prone lover threatened suicide if she did not leave her husband. Dire or magnificent, the issue always took Olivia an unscheduled ten minutes to resolve. It made her even more exotic than her half-Chinese and half-European Jewish one-of-a-kind beauty. She loved signing her e- mails "xoxo your Chinkajew."<br><br>At precisely 10:10, she arrived. She waved a languid hello, parked, and joined us on our pilgrimage past the roasting cars to the bland seventies industrial warehouse. We squeezed in a huddle around the shoulder-high reception desk, firing way too many questions. What exactly is a face- whitening facial? Could we get five salt scrubs at the same time? And the foot reflexology, too? What do you mean these wristbands track what we spend?<br><br>"For chrissakes, just pay and go in," snapped the woman behind us. I wheeled around with a ready retort, but then I saw the pileup behind us. The crowd was turning ugly.<br><br>"Sorry, sorry. Really sorry," the five of us called to the surging throng, throwing credit cards at the cashier.<br><br>In return we were handed the most god-awful gym outfits ever. We went to Dressing Room 1, where we ditched our street clothes and slipped into the mandatory uni-"sexless" Pepto-pink spa wear required for the coed areas. The color didn't work for me, but I was thrilled to feel diminutive in the "one size fits pretty much everyone on earth" getup. The best part--there were no pockets. No pockets meant no cell phones. Nobody--not work, the kids, my husband, or even my mother--could reach me for hours.<br><br>A thick glass wall separated the changing area from the bathhouse, a space so beautiful and strange, it stopped us dead in our tracks. It wasn't the immaculate elegance of the glass-and-stone-tile spa that got us. It wasn't the gargantuan hot, cold, and warm tubs; frigid open showers; or the sauna and steam rooms that knocked us out. It was the vision of dozens of naked women squatting at handheld shower stations scrubbing their most intimate anatomy with abandon, washing each other's backs, butts, breasts, and whatnots.<br><br>"Whoa! Now, that's different," Beth muttered in my ear. "Did the Times article say anything about that?"<br><br>"Looks great!" Vicki said. My brave sister was always up for anything. "Who wants to wash my pits?"<br><br>We stripped down to nothing in the locker room. Vicki strutted by with her new, postcancer rebuilt breasts. There was no way I could avoid them or the mortality that hovered over my once-invincible sister. These breasts were huge, two Pamela Anderson-sized mountains with riverbed scars running along their sides and bottoms.<br><br>"You could clean up on the strip circuit with those," I said, batting away the powerful combination of awe and upset with a one-liner. It was shocking to see that her breasts dwarfed mine when I had always been at least one cup size bigger, the one thing I inherited from my mother that she didn't.<br><br>"Yeah, it's bizarre. Men trip over themselves looking at these babies." Her wan smile turned into an angry pout. "I told that doctor to keep them the way they were. What is it with men? They want every woman to have gigantic hooters; therefore we must want them, too? I hate the surgeon. I told him to keep them small. But no-o-o. Now I'm stuck with these."<br><br>"Well, honey, they're magnificent," I soothed her.<br><br>"You really think so?" Vicki was still insecure after a double mastectomy, reconstructive surgery, and a couple of life-threatening infections over the past year. It was a miracle that we were standing here together.<br><br>We followed Beth, Sophia, and Olivia through the door to the spa. I lagged behind my sisterhood of four, watching their curvaceous bodies and round asses sway, hands fluttering as they brought each other up to date. I waded slowly into the hottest of the tubs, a large, shallow, blue-tiled pool ringed with at least a dozen women and girls, not one larger than my thigh. I settled near a jet and cooked. One by one, Vicki, Beth, Sophia, and Olivia joined me with the requisite "Argh! It's ho-o-ot. Oh, man! Ahhh, that's good!"<br><br>We found five spots together, and chatted about everyday work/kid stuff. This was always the prelude to the heavier subjects.<br><br>"You be quiet here. This peaceful place." A deep voice made us leap like startled fish. A burly bathhouse attendant loomed over us, her eyes stern with authority. "And you! You put up your hair!" She thrust rubber bands at Olivia, Beth, and me. Resentfully, Olivia piled her chestnut hair into a messy bun on top of her head; Beth and I followed her lead. Hair up, voices down. That lasted for about thirty seconds.<br><br>"Ya think we stand out enough?" Vicki said in her best Bronx honk. What didn't she inherit from our mother?<br><br>"Nah, we blend right in," I countered, glancing down at my ample C-cup breasts bobbing, cocking my head at the training bra-sized boobs of the dozen other boiling women and their offspring.<br><br>"One wrong move and my butt could cause some serious injury. I never saw so many small-boned people," Beth whispered.<br><br>"Maybe we should find a quieter corner," Olivia suggested. She looked me over as I stood up. "We sure have come a long way since I first interviewed you all those years ago. I'm so relieved I'm off the fertility beat. It broke my heart every time I produced one of those segments."<br><br>"At least you got me out of it," I answered. "Didn't that make working in daytime TV worthwhile?"<br><br>"So totally," she giggled, splashing water at me.<br><br>We trooped over to the uninhabited tepid tub, plunging back into the conversation the second we settled.<br><br>For me, it was an extension of the daily check-ins I had with Vicki and Olivia. Sophia called once every week or two. Beth was a different story altogether. We talked somewhere between two and fifty times a day, as we had for decades. It was like my ear had sprouted a blinking Bluetooth. I talked while doing the laundry, getting fresh produce, or trekking from fertility centers to pharmaceutical companies, making the fertility patient advocacy pitch. We craved the connection that some scientists say is a uniquely feminine thing. I think it's just human.<br><br>I was ready with my "back on Atkins--I have to lose sixty �ds--women are so screwed" rap when Beth usurped my place.<br><br>"I got the most amazing head last week," she burst out, totally smug.<br><br>Oh no she didn't! She'd switched up the order of our traditional agenda: weight and body image first, then sex. I looked to Sophia to put a stop to this. She was, after all, the grande dame of the group, our resident moderator. She rolled her eyes but didn't rescue me.<br><br>"Let me guess. It was Kevin. I'll bet my last paycheck it wasn't Larry," I snapped, my guts in a sudden uproar. This was a sex-talk ambush. I had to warm up before I could listen to her gush about the unbridled pleasure of her lover working away between her legs. I needed conversational foreplay. Beth met Kevin over free-range eggs at a food co-op a couple of years ago. Who knew organic groceries were an aphrodisiac? I'd been listening to her talk about him every day since. I saw him once getting out of a car, and that was close enough for me. None of us wanted to socialize with anybody's lover. It was enough to talk about them in excruciating detail.<br><br>Besides, it wasn't about a particular lover. It was about my friends dealing with the various stages of disgust, heartbreak, and finito with their marriages. Husbands who couldn't or wouldn't meet them where they were, as they were, now. Two of them found refuge in extramarital affairs. Vicki was seriously flirting with the idea, her discontent heightened by her brush with death.<br><br>Sophia, on the other hand, never stayed in a marriage long enough to have an affair. So she said.<br><br>Beth was unstoppable. "Well, Kev is fantastic. He loves women's bodies. He spends hours romancing the vulva."<br><br>Blech. I slid down and let the embryonic water cover my ears. I could still hear every word. They were sending out sex vibes that the water amplified until they were like shock waves. I felt them trigger an internal seismic upheaval I didn't understand. Usually our girl-time was a no-holds-barred free-for-all that I treasured. Why the talk today was provoking an anxiety attack was beyond me. But it was.<br><br>"I'm hungry," I announced, standing up fast enough to send waves crashing over the sides. "The Times said the food upstairs is delish--lots of protein and cabbage. Perfect for Atkins, which I'm back on, in case anybody is interested."<br><br>But before I could even step out of the tub, Vicki chimed in. "I can remember what that felt like. I still get that shiver when I run into some guy and the electricity starts running like crazy. I just don't have the patience to do anything about it. Yet." Vicki completely ignored my plea for kimchi. Olivia nodded in recognition. Her husband was brilliant, but a social nerd. Her boyfriend wasn't quite as smart, but he crackled with a crazy sexual energy and street smarts that turned her on. And that turned the always private, prim Olivia into a wild woman. She didn't talk about it much, but when she did, I could see her on the back of Colin's Harley, her thighs gripping his from behind. I didn't wait around for her to paint the image. I heaved myself out of the tub, almost falling down on the slippery tile. "I'm going upstairs to get a table," I said. I wrapped myself in the complimentary micro-mini-towel and stormed back to the dressing room.<br><br>I had been feeling uneasy since the night before. My youngest son, Ben, had found my dust-covered wedding album on the top shelf of our living room entertainment center. He pulled it down and started leafing through it, asking for the names of all the dead relatives. I sat on the couch next to him and annotated my ancient wedding party. He and I looked at the pictures of the slender, twenty-year-old bride and her fresh-faced groom. "Mom, you look like you were Andrew's age when you got married." He was stunned that I was ever that young.<br><br>"Well, I was only a couple of years older than Andrew, but I was even younger than he is now when I met Daddy. I was a mere seventeen on the cusp of eighteen."<br><br>I told Ben the familiar story of "how Daddy and I met" during my senior year at the Village School in Great Neck. I was a reporter on the school paper doing my version of an investigative piece on the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, a mysterious military college full of "older" men in uniform. It was a place where good girls didn't venture.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Go Where I Can&#39;t Follow</h2><p><p><b>A STORY OF LOVE AND LOSS INSCRIBED IN PHOTOGRAPHS, POSTCARDS, LETTERS, AND BEDSIDE SKETCHES</b></p><p>In this collection of letters, drawings, and photos, Anders Nilsen chronicles a six-year relationship and the illness that brought it to an end. </p><p><i>Don't Go Where I Can't Follow </i>is an eloquent appreciation of the time the author shared with his fianc�e, Cheryl Weaver.

It is a mixed-media composition, beginning with some postcards she sent him and his hilarious letter to his sister about a weekend camping trip fraught with tiny disasters. Then come photos and anecdotes from an accidental New Jersey stopover, a comics account of a trip to the Angoul�me comics festival, plenty of photos from his and Cheryl&#x2019;s subsequent French travels, his journal entries about her hospitalization, the portrayal in comics of scattering her ashes, four of his drawn-upon postcards to her, an old note to her envisioning her surviving him, the hand-lettered first edition afterword, and the typeset author&#x2019;s note for this edition. The climax of the book is the scattering of her ashes, to which Anders gives maximum impact and concentration by never attending to a single face, though many panels are crowded with people. A gem of modest, ordinary sublimity. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Gerhard Richter Forty Years of Painting /anglais</h2><p>Ranging from photo-based pictures to gestural abstraction, Gerhard Richter&#39;s diverse body of work calls into question many widely held attitudes about the inherent importance of stylistic consistency, the inaturali evolution of individual artistic sensibility, the spontaneous component of creativity, and the relationship of technological means and mass media imagery to traditional studio methods and formats. Unlike many of his peers, he has explored these issues through the medium of painting, challenging it to meet the demands posed by new forms of conceptual art. In every level of his varied output--from his austere photo-based realism of the early 60s, to his brightly colored gestural abstractions of the early 80s, to his startling cycle of black-and-white paintings of the Baader-Meinhof group--Richter has assumed a critical distance from vanguardists and conservatives alike regarding what painting should be. The result has been among the most convincing renewal of painting&#39;s vitality to be found in late 20th- and early 21st-century art. With an extensive and insightful critical essay by curator Robert Storr, a recent interview with the artist, a chronology, an exhibition history, and nearly 300 color and duotone reproductions, Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting marks a significant contribution to the understanding of contemporary art in general, and Gerhard Richter in particular.</p><p>The beautiful catalog <i>Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting</i> accompanies the Museum of Modern Art's retrospective of this prolific and important German artist. Richter's many artistic achievements vacillate between pure abstraction and a kind of realism. His realistic paintings, based primarily on personal photographs and images from newspapers, range in subject matter from the banal, like rolls of toilet paper, to the extremely potent, such as famous Nazi "doctor" Werner Hyde. The paintings have in common an emotional remove; the re-creating of photographic images points us toward our own possible emotional detachment to the influx of images in the world. A blurred chair, Jackie Kennedy, burning candles, family portraits--Richter lays them all out before us as if to say, Here, they are all the same. The insightful text by MoMA curator Robert Storr provides an in-depth look at Richter's life in postwar Germany, tracing the influences and environment that made his work possible. The book includes a revealing interview with the artist and a detailed chronology of his life and work, plus 138 color illustrations and 165 duotones. <i>--J.P. Cohen</i>Robert Storr is the Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. He has published monographs on Philip Guston, Robert Ryman and Raymond Pettibon, and has been a contributing editor at "Art in America" since 1981. He is also the author of "Gerhard Richter: October 18, 1977". <p> Born in 1932 in Dresden, Germany, Gerhard Richter grew up under National Socialism and lived for 16 years under East German Communism before moving to West Germany in 1961. In the heady artistic milieu of Cologne and Dusseldorf in the 1960s, Richter discovered Art Informel, Neo-Dada, and Fluxus, and, together with Sigmar Polke and Konrad Lueg, briefly formed a satirical variant of Pop called "Capitalist Realism." Since then, he has emerged as one of the essential painters of the postwar period, pioneering realism with paintings made from photographs. His work has also profoundly engaged with Neo-Expressinism and Abstract Art.</p></p><h2>Treasured Classics</h2><p>Acclaimed illustrator Michael Hague brings his hallmark artistry to 15 classic stories that have delighted children for generations.

First serial, House Beautiful. Tour.</p><p>Mac Griswold, a garden historian, is co-author of The Golden Age of American Gardens. She writes frequently for the New York Times and many magazines, and she lectures extensively. She lives in New York City and Sag Harbor, Long Island, where she is experimenting with drought-resistant plants in her backyard.<br>In this engaging book, Griswold (The Golden Age of American Gardens, Abrams, 1991) draws a very appealing and human portrait of George Washington as farmer and gardener. She notes that the "secret George," a figure increasingly remote from our time, can be seen as more accessible through his "passionate domesticity." Her text conjures up a man who walked his fields, puttered in his gardens, and, when politics called him away, shopped at nurseries for desirable plants to ship home. It is also a fascinating introduction to gardening and farming practices in late 18th-century America. Washington tried many agricultural innovations, though ultimately the infertility of the land defeated many of them. Nor does Griswold ignore the reality of slave labor at the plantation, "the unwilling machinery of his farm." Washington's innovations made more work for them, but some ultimately benefited by becoming skilled farmers rather than unskilled field hands. The beauty of his garden design has endured, however, and Griswold includes many tips from the present gardeners at Mount Vernon on growing plants typical of Washington's day. Recommended for most gardening collections.

Was the gunfire<br>from out in the street, would you say?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Well, obviously.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;As distinct from one of these houses?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I get you. I couldn&#x2019;t say that. How could I tell?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Do you remember if there was a vehicle nearby?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;There are some parking spaces that get filled up quickly. Otherwise<br>it&#x2019;s double yellow lines all the way.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not talking about parked cars, for God&#x2019;s sake. Did you hear<br>anything after the shots, like a car or a motorbike moving off?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t remember any. I could be wrong. I was in shock, to be<br>honest.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You keep saying &#x201c;to be honest&#x201d;. You&#x2019;d better be honest with me,<br>young man. We&#x2019;ll need a written statement from you. Everything<br>you remember.&#x2019; Lockton nods to the constable and leaves her to<br>start the paperwork.<br><br>It is still before 4.30 a.m.<br><br>Reinforcements are arriving all the time. Lockton knows he<br>could find himself replaced any minute as the Senior Investigating<br>Officer. He needs to make his opportunity count, and soon. He<br>moved over to where the police surgeon has now stepped back<br>from the body.<br><br>The shooting fits the pattern of the previous attacks. The entry<br>wound is above the right ear. The bullet must have fragmented<br>inside the skull, shattering much of the opposite side of the head.<br>It&#x2019;s not a sight you want to linger over.<br>&#x2018;Nothing I can tell you that isn&#x2019;t obvious. A single bullet wound.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;We think there may have been more than one shot,&#x2019; Lockton<br>says.<br>&#x2018;Have you found other bullets, then?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Not yet. Other priorities. Is there any way of telling the direction<br>of the shots?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Depends where he was when he was hit. The bullet entered here,<br>quite high up on the right temple, and you can see that most of<br>the tissue damage is lower down on the opposite side. That could<br>be an angle for you to work with.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re talking about the trajectory?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s for you to work out. I&#x2019;m only here to examine the body.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;A high velocity bullet?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m a doctor, not a gun expert.&#x2019;<br><br>Ken Lockton goes into deduction mode. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s unlikely the shooting<br>was from ground level, so it&#x2019;s a good bet he fired from above<br>us, like a window over one of the shops.&#x2019; He&#x2019;s pleased with that.<br>CID would approve.<br><br>&#x2018;In that case, he would have been walking away from the town<br>centre, towards Walcot.&#x2019;<br>Lockton isn&#x2019;t sure now. He betrays some of the tension he feels<br>by chewing his thumbnail. &#x2018;The right side, you say.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You can see for yourself.&#x2019;<br>Actually he&#x2019;s seen more than he wants to. He doesn&#x2019;t need to<br>look again to know where the bullet entered. He gives a nervous<br>laugh. &#x2018;His shift was nearly over. He should have been heading the<br>opposite way, back towards Manvers Street nick.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;So?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;If you&#x2019;re right, the killer wasn&#x2019;t on the shop side. He must<br>have been somewhere behind us.&#x2019; He turns to look again at that<br>massive brick rampart along the west side of the street, a far cry<br>from the cleaned-up stone structures that grace most of the city.<br>Blackened by two centuries of pollution, the wall is tall enough<br>and grim enough to enclose a prison.<br><br>A disused Victorian fountain is recessed into the brickwork<br>under an arch flanked by granite columns.

There&#x2019;s nothing more to keep me here.&#x2019;<br>Lockton is too absorbed to answer.<br><br>Left of the fountain his eyes light on an ancient flight of steps<br>leading up to Bladud Buildings. Is that where the shot was fired<br>from? The gunman could have made his escape up there and be<br>in a different street.<br><br>His heart-rate quickening, Lockton crosses for a closer inspection,<br>runs halfway up the steps and at once discovers a difficulty.<br>It is far too narrow. To have fired from a height the sniper needs<br>to have been at least this far up, but the tall sides mask the view.<br>You can&#x2019;t see the fallen man from here. The sniper would have<br>needed to wait for his victim to draw level across the street. The<br>shooting from the steps didn&#x2019;t happen.<br><br>Cursing, Lockton descends, returns to the middle of the street,<br>stares at that long expanse of wall and gets a better idea. Up to<br>now he has accepted the structure without fully taking it in. Now<br>he can see that the brickwork isn&#x2019;t entirely solid.

Wilson Professor of the Humanities at Northwestern University. He is the author of <i>The Measure of All Things,</i> published to worldwide acclaim in fourteen languages. He lives in Evanston, Illinois.<b>Prologue</b><p>In June 1792 -- in the dying days of the French monarchy, as the world began to revolve around a new promise of Revolutionary equality -- two astronomers set out in opposite directions on an extraordinary quest. The erudite and cosmopolitan Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre made his way north from Paris, while the cautious and scrupulous Pierre-Fran�ois-Andr� M�chain made his way south. Each man left the capital in a customized carriage stocked with the most advanced scientific instruments of the day and accompanied by a skilled assistant. Their mission was to measure the world, or at least that piece of the meridian arc which ran from Dunkerque through Paris to Barcelona. Their hope was that all the world's peoples would henceforth use the globe as their common standard of measure. Their task was to establish this new measure -- "the meter" -- as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator.</p><p>The meter would be eternal because it had been taken from the earth, which was itself eternal. And the meter would belong equally to all the people of the world, just as the earth belonged equally to them all. In the words of their Revolutionary colleague Condorcet -- the founder of mathematical social science and history's great optimist -- the metric system was to be "for all people, for all time."</p><p>We often hear that science is a revolutionary force that imposes radical new ideas on human history. But science also emerges from within human history, reshaping ordinary actions, some so habitual we hardly notice them. Measurement is one of our most ordinary actions. We speak its language whenever we exchange precise information or trade objects with exactitude. This very ubiquity, however, makes measurement invisible. To do their job, standards must operate as a set of shared assumptions, the unexamined background against which we strike agreements and make distinctions. So it is not surprising that we take measurement for granted and consider it banal. Yet the use a society makes of its measures expresses its sense of fair dealing. That is why the balance scale is a widespread symbol of justice. The admonition is found in the Old Testament: "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. Just balances, just weights, a just <i>ephah,</i> and a just <i>hin,</i> shall ye have." Our methods of measurement define who we are and what we value.</p><p>The men who created the metric system understood this. They were the preeminent scientific thinkers of the Enlightenment, an age which had elevated reason to the rank of "sole despot of the universe." These savants -- as the investigators who studied nature were known in those days -- had a modern face looking toward our own times, and an older face glancing back toward the past. In their own minds, of course, they were not two-faced; it was their world which was two-faced, with its burdensome past obstructing progress and a utopian future waiting to be born.</p><p>The savants were appalled by the diversity of weights and measures they saw all around them. Measures in the eighteenth century not only differed from nation to nation, but within nations as well. This diversity obstructed communication and commerce, and hindered the rational administration of the state. It also made it difficult for the savants to compare their results with those of their colleagues. One Englishman, traveling through France on the eve of the Revolution, found the diversity there a torment. "[I]n France," he complained, "the infinite perplexity of the measures exceeds all comprehension. They differ not only in every province, but in every district and almost every town...." Contemporaries estimated that under the cover of some eight hundred names, the Ancien R�gime of France employed a staggering 250,000 different units of weights and measures.</p><p>In place of this Babel of measurement, the savants imagined a universal language of measures that would bring order and reason to the exchange of both goods and information. It would be a rational and coherent system that would induce its users to think about the world in a rational and coherent way. But all the savants' grand plans would have remained fantasy had not the French Revolution -- history's great utopian rupture -- provided them with an unexpected chance to throw off the shackles of custom and build a new world upon principled foundations. Just as the French Revolution had proclaimed universal rights for all people, the savants argued, so too should it proclaim universal measures. And to ensure that their creation would not be seen as the handiwork of any single group or nation, they decided to derive its fundamental unit from the measure of the world itself.</p><p>For seven years Delambre and M�chain traveled the meridian to extract this single number from the curved surface of our planet. They began their journey in opposite directions, and then, when they had reached the extremities of their arc, measured their way back toward one another through a country quickened with revolution. Their mission took them to the tops of filigree cathedral spires, to the summits of domed volcanoes, and very nearly to the guillotine. It was an operation of exquisite precision for such violent times. At every turn they encountered suspicion and obstruction. How do you measure the earth while the world is turning beneath your feet? How do you establish a new order when the countryside is in chaos? How do you set standards at a time when everything is up for grabs? Or is there, in fact, no better time to do so?</p><p>At last, their seven years of travel done, the two astronomers converged on the southern fortress town of Carcassonne, and from there returned to Paris to present their data to an International Commission, the world's first international scientific conference. The results of their labors were then enshrined in a meter bar of pure platinum. It was a moment of triumph: proof that in the midst of social and political upheaval, science could produce something of permanence. Accepting the fruit of their labor, France's new supreme ruler made a prophesy. "Conquests will come and go," Napoleon Bonaparte declared, "but this work will endure."</p><p>In the last two hundred years, conquests have indeed come and gone, but the meter has become the measure of all things. The metric system serves today as the common language of high-tech communications, cutting-edge science, machine production, and international commerce. Older forms of measurement have receded as the metric system has made possible trade and economic coordination on a fully global scale. Paradoxically, the leading nation in the global economy remains the sole exception to this rule. Thomas Jefferson failed to convince Congress to make the United States the second nation to adopt the metric system, and every reformer since has met the same fate. John Quincy Adams, asked to consider whether the United States should adhere to the metric system, called it the greatest invention since the printing press and predicted it would save more human labor than the steam engine. Yet he recommended against its adoption. Only in recent years have American manufacturers begun retooling for metric units. Few Americans realize that a silent revolution is finally underway in their nation, transforming their measures under the pressures of the new global economy.</p><p>As things stand, of course, this conversion is embarrassingly incomplete. Americans became painfully aware of this fact in 1999 with the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter. A NASA investigation into the satellite's failure revealed that one team of engineers had used traditional American units, while another had used metric units. The result was a trajectory error of sixty miles, and a $125-million disappearing act.</p><p>The Revolutionary scientists created the metric system two hundred years ago to avoid just this sort of fiasco. One of their aims was to facilitate communication among scientists, engineers, and administrators. Their grander ambition was to transform France -- and ultimately, the whole world -- into a free market for the open exchange of goods and information. Today, their goal seems within reach. Over 95 percent of the world's population now officially uses the metric system, and its success is touted as one of the benign triumphs of globalization.</p><p>But behind the public triumph of the metric system lies a long and bitter history. The fundamental fallacy of utopianism is to assume that everyone wants to live in the same utopia. France, it turns out, was not only the first nation to invent the metric system; she was also the first to reject it. For decades after its introduction ordinary people spurned the new system, and clung to their local measures and the local economies they sustained. In the face of this revolt from below, Napoleon, on the eve of his disastrous invasion of Russia, returned France to the Paris measures of the Ancien R�gime. Now he mocked the global aspirations of the men he had once admired. "It was not enough for them to make forty million people happy," he sneered, "they wanted to sign up the whole universe." Not until the middle of the nineteenth century did France revert to the metric system, and even then use of the old measures persisted into the twentieth. It would take enormous scientific effort and years of bitter conflict to make metric measurement banal, just as it had taken a Revolution to bring the metric system into being. Things might easily have turned out differently.</p><p>What neither advocates nor opponents of the metric system could have known is that a secret error lies at the heart of the metric system -- an error perpetuated in every subsequent definition of the meter. Indeed, as I discovered in the course of my research, the only people who could have known the full extent of this error were Delambre and M�chain themselves.</p><p>For those who wish to know the origins of the metric system, there is one place to turn: the official account composed by one of the leaders of the meridian expedition, the north-going astronomer, Jean-Bap...</p></p><h2>All This Could Be Yours</h2><p><b>&#x201c;All hail Jami Attenberg, the queen of dysfunctional families.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Refinery29</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Big Little Lies</i> meets <i>Succession</i> in the scorching heat of the Big Easy . . .&nbsp;Money, power and family are touched upon through Attenberg&#x2019;s emotional, humorous and sharply written accounts.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Parade</i></b><br><b>&#x201c;This is how you write a very good novel about a very bad man.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></b><br><br><b>From critically acclaimed<i> New York Times</i> best-selling author Jami Attenberg comes a novel of family secrets: think the drama of <i>Big Little Lies </i>set in the heat of a New Orleans summer</b><br><br> &#x201c;If I know why they are the way they are, then maybe I can learn why I am the way I am,&#x201d; says Alex Tuchman of her parents.

During the Depression, from 1935 to 1937, Evans took part in the most extensive photographic project ever carried out in the United States--the pictorial survey of the Farm Security Administration. The now-legendary collaboration with James Agee that resulted in the masterpiece <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> documents his dedication to photographing the country he knew. Evans' talented eye and sensitive heart make him one of the great photographers of the twentieth century. This volume contains many of his best-known images.</p><p>Born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1903, <b>Walker Evans</b> studied at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1926-27. Mainly self-taught as a photographer, he worked freelance in New York starting in 1928. He was part of Roy Stryker's Farm Security Administration project as a staff photographer in the Southern United States from 1935 to 1937. From 1945 to 1965 he was an associate editor and photographer for <i>Fortune </i>magazine. After retiring from professional photography in 1965, he became a professor at Yale University, where he taught generations of young photographers in documentary approach. Evans received three Guggenheim Fellowships, as well as many other awards, and his work is included in museum collections around the world. He died in 1975 in New Haven, Connecticut.<br>"In Evans's world, even the inanimate things, bureau drawers, pots, tires, bricks, signs, seem waiting in their own patient dignity, posing for their pictures." --Lincoln Kirstein<br></p><h2>The Visual Dictionary of American Domestic Architecture (Henry Holt Reference Book)</h2><p>A guide to American home design features more than six hundred illustrations that depict examples of such structures as the Navajo hogan, Craftsman bungalow, and Georgian manor, and includes floor plans and identifying decorative details.</p><p>This collection of detailed black-and-white drawings of houses and other domestic buildings (barns, garages, gazebos) is presented in 12 chapters arranged chronologically, from Native American dwellings to contemporary trends. Each chapter is introduced by one page of text, and additional comments accompany the illustrations. Each drawing is labeled with the names of various architectural details.<p>Several examples are provided for each time period. For example, seven drawings reflect Federal-style homes in the chapter on neoclassical styles. The section on prefab housing in the postwar chapter includes traditional kit structures as well as Quonset huts and mobile homes. Some drawings highlight special interior or exterior features: fireplaces, staircases, gates, and so on. A series of inserts called "anatomies" look at basic construction methods: trusses, double-hung sashes, log notching. Floor plans are often provided. One helpful feature is that common usage is included in parenthesis next to technical terms that accompany illustrations; for example, split-wood shingles are also defined as <i>shakes</i>, a thatched sun shelter is also identified as a <i>ramada</i>.</p><p>Intended for architecture students and design professionals, this book could also be used as a resource for secondary school American history units. The first chapter covers Native American dwellings such as Algonquin wigwams, Apache wikiups, Navaho hogans, and Tlingit plank houses, and chapter 8 deals with folk and frontier houses. The index includes all the terms used as labels.</p><p>A better choice for public and school collections is the <i>Eyewitness Visual Dictionary of Buildings</i> (Dorling Kindersley, 1992), which uses photographs as well as illustrations and spans all sorts of structures from ancient through modern times. Other visual dictionaries, such as the <i>Macmillan Visual Desk Reference</i> (1993) and <i>What's What: A Visual Glossary of the Physical World</i> (Hammond, 1981), also include sections on architecture that satisfy many browsing and general reference needs. However, as a specialized resource, Carley's unique graphic guide will be a welcome addition to architecture and design collections. <i></i></p>This attractive dictionary presents the details and styles of residential architecture in the United States through over 500 annotated drawings. Skibinski and Lam base these examples on magazine illustrations and measured drawings from the Historic American Buildings Survey. Particularly useful are the clearly delineated illustrations that focus on construction technology (the anatomy of a double-hung sash and a balloon frame building, for example). Carley's (The Backyard Book, LJ 5/1/88) text would have benefited from a more expansive discussion of regional variations in style and specific information with which to date buildings. While the most useful book of this type remains Virginia and Lee McAlester's Field Guide to American Houses (LJ 8/84), this dictionary, designed for use by homeowners and curious tourists, is a welcome addition to the field.

If you are a victim of a stalker or suspect that you might be, this book will give you the means, not only to assist in your protection, but hopefully to assist law enforcement in putting the stalker behind bars. Veteran detective Mike Proctor, who has investigated and consulted on over 100 stalking cases (all of which have been successfully prosecuted), has written this essential survival guide for anyone who becomes the target of one of these predators. He teaches you: how to identify a stalker, how and why they stalk, what to do if you are being stalked, how to collect evidence, and how to get the criminal justice system on your side.A pioneer in the investigation of stalking, Proctor continues his quest in educating both the law enforcement community and the public to the seriousness of the crimes generated by these urban predators. He discusses how all victims are subjected to some type of mental abuse either in the form of direct or indirect threats. In some cases these threats can lead to both physical trauma and even death.Proctor lays out many of the behavioral patterns the stalker uses to ply his trade: persistent contact through various means of harassment (phones, pagers, letters); breaking and entering, either to steal some personal items or just to let the victim know that his or her personal space has been violated; as well as a host of other harassment tactics, including contacting family members, filing legal actions, disrupting utility services, threats of violence, and the latest trend: cyberstalking.With his wealth of experience, Proctor offers keen insights into the twisted mindset of the stalker. For example, a great deal of stalking arises out of a domestic violence situation. Other stalkers are fantasy driven, some believing (falsely) that their victim is in love with them. Stalkers rarely take responsibility for their actions, blaming others for making them do what they do; most have stalked more than one person. Some are disgruntled employees seeking revenge against business associates or employers, an increasing phenomenon in the workplace.Complete with many examples form actual case files, this comprehensive and informative handbook takes a hard look at a serious and growing international social problem. This guide should greatly assist those who are current or potential victims of stalking, victim advocates, law enforcement, as well as employers and their personnel staffs.</p><p>Detective Mike Proctor (Westminster, CA), a thirty-year veteran of the Westminster Police Department, is a recognized expert on stalking who has worked and consulted on over 100 stalking cases. He has appeared on 20/20, America&#39;s Most Wanted, CNN, The Maury Povich Show, Unsolved Mysteries, and Case Closed, and is frequently quoted in the press. He also consulted on the 1996 Police Officers Standards and Training video training course on stalking and teaches at both the professional and university level.""At last, a book about a tough topic that will make a difference.... the author.... is more experienced than anyone. I know.... I recommend without reservation"<br><br>""Det. Proctor has written, hands down, the best practical guide on how to stop a stalker...."</p><h2>Bohemian Manifesto: A Field Guide to Living on the Edge</h2><p>Bohemianism is a way of life, a state of mind, an atmosphere. It is not a trend, its a timeless movement. It is about living beyond convention. BOHEMIAN MANIFESTO explores and joyfully celebrates the creativity, the originality, and the splendor of a lifestyle and spirit shared by free-thinking, free-living artists, poets, writers, sculptors, musicians, and intellectuals. This is the first book to distill and categorize all the ingredients of Bohemian life. In a witty and engaging style, Laren Stover examines the contents of a Bohemians closet, bathroom, and bookshelf. She explains the allure of absinthe, why it isnt wise to leave a Bohemian unattended in your home--you could return to find nude nymphs painted on your lamp shades--and how to identify what type of Bohemian you might be.</p><p>Laren Stover is the author of The Bombshell Manual of Style, and a novel, Pluto, Animal Lover, a finalist for The Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers award. She has been a resident of Yaddo and Hawthornden Castle and received the Ludwig Vogelstein Foundation grant for fiction in 1991. Her writing has appeared in The New York Times, Bomb, and The New York Observer. She lives in New York. <br>Stover (The Bombshell Manual of Style) wrote her playful anthropology of Bohemian culture from an insider&#x2019;s viewpoint. The daughter of Bohemians, at one time a fully practicing Bohemian, and a now a Bohemian "with some bourgeois pretense," she is clearly steeped in the lifestyle. In this book, she documents the most important attributes of the five variations of Bohemians (Nouveau, Gypsy, Beat, Zen and Dandy) and of Bohemian philosophy generally, beginning with a "diagnosis" that serves mostly to emphasize how varied Bohemians are and how fiercely they resist any kind of classification. Stover is fully aware of the futile nature of her quest to pin down such elusive characters, and her writing is accordingly ironic, full of asides and amusing pseudo-scholarly footnotes. The book&#x2019;s four main parts describe Bohemians in all their counterculture splendor, with short sections on everything from typical Bohemian names ("they name their offspring with the same whimsical sensibility with which they name their pets"), clothes, typical relationships, choice of reading material and music, and eating habits (featuring "The Twenty-Four-Hour Menu of the Starving Bohemian"). In fictionalized profiles of nine Bohemians from around the world, including Dantini the septuagenarian magician and Atlas the Dutch artist, Stover brings these unusual figures to life in a wonderfully familiar way. True Bohemians certainly won&#x2019;t need this book to decide whether they&#x2019;re Bohemian, but may enjoy these humorous takes on their subculture, and non-Bohemians will find it a delightful introduction to that unique existence.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Irish photographer and skateboarder Richard Gilligan spent four years traveling through Europe and the US to photograph homemade skateparks. The resulting photographs are not your run-of-the-mill action shots filled with miraculous body moves, slashes, twists, and turns. Instead, Gilligan chooses to focus on the sport&#x2019;s "negative space": the out-of-the-way concrete embankments, nondescript suburban lots where kids come to practice, a simple wooden ramp so insubstantial that no one but a skateboarder would recognize its use. Many of these photographs can be appreciated as unique, if prosaic, landscapes, but Gilligan also populates his pictures with skaters at rest, smoking alone, hanging out together, or walking home, board in hand. The images offer a grittily beautiful tribute to the ineffable hunger that unites all skateboarders&#x2014;young, old, rich, poor. In these photographs Gilligan realizes the act of skating represents more than a quest for glory, but a means of self expression.</p><p>Richard Gilligan&#39;s work has been exhibited worldwide with recent exhibitions in Dublin, London, Berlin, Dusseldorf, Los Angeles, and the 2013 Copenhagen Photo Festival. He has worked as a contributing photographer to a wide range of international magazines and has been documenting homemade skateparks worldwide since 2008. He was recently awarded the 2013 Showcase Photography Award, which highlights and supports the best of contemporary practice in Ireland.</p><h2>Exploring the North Coast of British Columbia: Blunden Harbour to Dixon Entrance, Including the Queen Charlotte Islands, 2nd Ed.</h2><p>Exploring the North Coast of British Columbia takes seafaring explorers from the famous Nakwakto Rapids to the Alaska border.

Juliana Spahr has lived in many places, including Chillicothe (Ohio), Buffalo (New York), Honolulu (Hawaii), and Brooklyn (New York). She has absorbed, participated in, and been transformed by the politics and ecologies of each. This book is about that process. THE TRANSFORMATION "tells a barely truthful story of the years 1997-2001," a story of flora and fauna, of continents, islands, academies, connective tissue, military and linguistic operations, and of that ever-present <i>we</i>, to name only a few. At once exhilarating, challenging, and humbling, THE TRANSFORMATION is a hefty book in its honesty and scope, a must-read.</p><p>Juliana Spahr was born in Chillicothe, Ohio in 1966. Spahr received her BA from Bard College in Languages and Literatures and her PhD from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York in English. She has taught at Siena College (1996-7), the University of Hawaii at Manoa (1997-2003), and Mills College (2003-present). She co-edits the journal Chain with Jena Osman. Her books include The Transformation (Atelos, 2007), This Connection of Everyone with Lungs (U of California, 2005), things of each possible relation hashing against one another (Palm Press, 2003), Fuck You-Aloha-I Love You (Wesleyan U, 2001), Everybody's Autonomy: Connective Reading and Collective Identity (U of Alabama, 2001), and Response (Sun &amp; Moon, 1996).Spahr's latest is a fascinating poetic memoir along the lines of <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, charting the personal and political transformation that is at the root of books like Spahr's tender, blistering <i>This Connection of Everyone with Lungs</i> (2005). A prose work in nine parts (plus bibliographical afterword), the book covers the years 1997&#x2013;2001, when Spahr's primary relationship expanded to include a third partner (forming what she, with wry, Stein-like splendor, refers to as a they); she entered the academic job market (with complicated results); and the excesses of the Clinton-Bush era transformed into the nightmare of 9/11. As the book unfolds, the three partners struggle to define their relationship to each other and, more awkwardly, to other people. Spahr's university job on an island in the Pacific enmeshes the three in the island's fraught race politics; they're on sabbatical in Brooklyn when 9/11 happens. Spahr, who has written about Stein, adapts Stein's repetitive, pronominally elusive style, but where Stein gossips and drops names, Spahr fugues and protects the innocent. That approach piques the desire for dish, and it keeps the focus on the anxieties, excitements and sly, trenchant analyses that the three experience and produce together. The result is a book as unique as it is beautiful.<i> (June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In recent years with the use of modern manufacturing techniques, the benefits of consuming raw colostrum have been preserved in powdered colostrum. In the last ten years more advanced fractionation technologies have allowed the large-scale production of liquid colostrum supplements. Now we are observing a revival in the use of colostrum liquids and powders. Colostrum Peptides, more commonly known as Proline-rich Polypeptides (PRPs) are isolated in these liquid colostrum products.

The 20 million Christian Sabbath-keepers in Africa demonstrate that the seventh day Sabbath is a mark of African consciousness, and independence from European civilization.</p><p>Charles E. Bradford is a much-loved preacher, pastor, administrator in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. HIs dynamic pulpit ministry, clear thinking, and moral fearlessness have endeared him to congregations in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Dallas, Texas; and New York City. For 11 years he served as President of the North American Division of the Seventh-day Adventists, the first African-American to hold that post.Black Africans have a unique proclivity toward accepting the seventh-day Sabbath. Historically, Ethiopia, and many other parts of black Africa have been bastions of Sabbatarianism. Their isolation, for centuries, from the corrupting influence of Rome has allowed Africans to maintain much spiritual independence. Today, Christianity in general, and Sabbath-keeping in particular, is exploding in sub-Saharan Africa. <p>Ethiopia (Abyssinia) is a nation defined throughout its existence by its fidelity to the seventh-day Sabbath. Today, the numbers of Sabbath-keepers are exploding in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Gabon, Congo, and elsewhere. </p><p>Sabbath Roots by Charles E. Bradford, is not just a book for black people, but for all of Gods children.

In New York by 1738, Johnson moved to the frontiers along the Mohawk River, where he established himself as a fur trader and eventually became a landowner with vast estates; served as principal British intermediary with the Iroquois Confederacy; command British, colonial, and Iroquois forces that defeated the French in the battle of Lake George in 1755; and created the first groups of "rangers," who fought like Indians and led the way to the Patriots' victories in the Revolution. <br><br>As Fintan O'Toole's superbly researched, colorfully dramatic narrative makes clear, the key to Johnson's signal effectiveness was the style in which he lived as a "white savage." Johnson had two wives, one European, one Mohawk; became fluent in Mohawk; and pioneered the use of Indians as active partners in the making of a new America. O'Toole's masterful use of the extraordinary (often hilariously misspelled) documents written by Irish, Dutch, German, French, and Native American participants in Johnson's drama enlivens the account of this heroic figure's legendary career; it also suggests why Johnson's early multiculturalism unraveled, and why the contradictions of his enterprise created a historical dead end.<br></p><p>William Johnson was scarcely more than a boy when he left Ireland and his Gaelic, Roman Catholic family to become a Protestant in the service of Britain's North American empire.

The affair in question involves Maurice Bendrix, a solipsistic novelist, and a dutifully married woman, Sarah Miles. The lovers meet at a party thrown by Sarah's dreary civil-servant husband, and proceed to liberate each other from boredom and routine unhappiness. Reflecting on the ebullient beginnings of their romance, Bendrix recalls: "There was never any question in those days of who wanted whom--we were together in desire." Indeed, the affair goes on unchecked for several years until, during an afternoon tryst, Bendrix goes downstairs to look for intruders in his basement and a bomb falls on the building. Sarah rushes down to find him lying under a fallen door, and immediately makes a deal with God, whom she has never particularly cared for. "I love him and I'll do anything if you'll make him alive.... I'll give him up forever, only let him be alive with a chance.... People can love each other without seeing each other, can't they, they love You all their lives without seeing You." <p> Bendrix, as evidenced by his ability to tell the story, is not dead, merely unconscious, and so Sarah must keep her promise. She breaks off the relationship without giving a reason, leaving Bendrix mystified and angry. The only explanation he can think of is that she's left him for another man. It isn't until years later, when he hires a private detective to ascertain the truth, that he learns of her impassioned vow. Sarah herself comes to understand her move through a strange rationalization. Writing to God in her journal, she says: </p><blockquote> You willed our separation, but he [Bendrix] willed it too. He worked for it with his anger and his jealousy, and he worked for it with his love. For he gave me so much love, and I gave him so much love that soon there wasn't anything left, when we'd finished, but You. </blockquote> It's as though the pull toward faith were inevitable, if incomprehensible--perhaps as punishment for her sin of adultery. In her final years, Sarah's faith only deepens, even as she remains haunted by the bombing and the power of her own attraction to God. Set against the backdrop of a war-ravaged city, <i>The End of the Affair</i> is equally haunting as it lays forth the question of what constitutes love in troubling, unequivocal terms. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i>The love affair between Maurice Bendix and Sarah, flourishing in the turbulent times of the London Blitz, ends when she suddenly breaks it off. A chance meeting rekindles his love and jealousy two years later, and Bendix hires a private detective to follow Sarah. Slowly his love for her turns into an obsession. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Little Britches</h2><p>Ralph Moody was eight years old in 1906 when his family moved from New Hampshire to a Colorado ranch.

When he goes off to capture Cetus, he eschews having a boat: a masterful illustration shows him riding a wave as he chases the whale, who ingeniously exudes attitude. Cetus rams through a school of fish, so Peggony-Po did underwater cartwheels to keep those fish from crying. He never slowed down. As Peggony-Po rides Cetus from tropical waters to icy coasts, he crows, What a way to see the world! Richly descriptive similes&#x2013;as feisty as a kettle of just-caught fish and Like a pressing iron flattening a shirtsleeve&#x2013;and phrases such as He [Cetus] loved to smash boats with a single slam of his tail convey dynamically both the absurdity and thrilling adventure of this story, and the illustrations brim with activity and energy. Peggony-Po dances a jig from the lookout mast, he becomes alive and starts talking to his father as he is sculpted, and Cetus blows boats into the sky and rails off a fence. Every library will want to buy at least one copy of this exuberant story that begins with a whale, ends with a whale, and has a whole lot of whale in its middle.<i>&#x2013;Kirsten Cutler, Sonoma Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Box Kite. The Cat. The Milk Carton. The Reclining Picasso. These are the playful names given to the eccentric beach houses of Andrew Geller. Built in the 1950s and 1960s, these whimsical vacation homes reflected the idea of summer leisure for a generation more concerned with fun on the beach than ostentatious display. For clients in the Hamptons, the Jersey shore, and in New England, Geller built dozens of houses, most of wood and most on modest budgets. Geller, who worked with Raymond Loewy and directed the design of such modernist landmarks as the Lever House in New York, combined a modern interest in light, breeze, and functional living with playful form-making. These spirited houses, many shown here for the first time through vintage photographs and drawings, still delight today and will inspire anyone interested in beach house living.</p><p>Alastair Gordon is a contributing editor at House &amp; Garden and a regular contributor to the New York Times. He is the author of Weekend Utopia: Modern Living in the Hamptons and resides in Princeton, NJ.Gordon (Weekend Utopia) takes readers on a tour of "quixotic designer-architect" Geller's beach houses in this handsomely illustrated homage. Geller, a long-time designer at the Loewy Corporation, a pioneering industrial design firm, made a name for himself in the 1950s and 60s when he began taking commissions to build architecturally adventurous summer houses in Sagaponack, Amagansett and other beach towns. His playful designs made the most of their location-generally, these were small houses on small lots, and windows opening onto the beach were crucial-and often reflected important parts of their owners' personalities: a Kodak executive's house was a boxy structure with "lenslike" windows, while a well-known ladies' man's dwelling looked a little like a "square brassiere." Later, Geller worked on the Leisurama brand of prefabricated summer homes, which were sold at Macy's and came furnished, right down to towels and toothbrushes. As Gordon writes, "each one of Geller's houses told a story and sometimes, in his best work, this story took the form of a kind of comic-strip imagery that recalled Krazy Kat, Rube Goldberg, Betty Boop, and the bebop jazz that Geller admired." While many of the houses Geller designed were destroyed in hurricanes, demolished to make room for McMansions or remodeled and expanded beyond recognition, the photographs and architectural drawings in this volume bring them appealingly back to life. 25 color, 60 b&amp;w illustrations. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sound of the Trumpet</h2><p>The first time beautiful, wealthy Lisle Kingsley sees John Sargent, she knows she loves him.

Illustrated with color and historic black-and-white photographs, artwork, and maps, it is the story of how the Ojibwe people and their ways have continued to survive, and even thrive, from pre-contact times to the present.</p><p>This is the story of the Anishinaabe, or Ojibwe people, who have lived on the North American continent for many thousands of years. Beginning in the dim past and continuing to the present, Ojibwe: We Look in All Directions chronicles in text, photography, and illustrations the saga of a still vibrant and evolving people, still strong in their ways. <p>What is known of Ojibwe origins begins soon after the last ice age, recorded by their Lenape ancestors on bark tablets and song sticks in an epic poem, the Wallum Olum. The Wallum Olum describes an eastward journey across the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains to the eastern Woodlands, where the Lenape settled along the Delaware River. From there they branched out to become several distinct tribal nations. </p><p>The Ojibwe lived for untold generations in the St. Lawrence River Valley in what is present-day Newfoundland. There they were told in a series of prophecies of their future, including a westward migration. This westward journey took over five hundred years, leading them at last to Moningwunakauning&#x2014;place of the golden-breasted woodpecker. Known today as Madeline Island (just offshore Bayfield, Wisconsin), Moningwunakauning is the great spiritual homeland of the Ojibwe people. Eventually the Ojibwe developed communities in which they continue to live today, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and southern Canada. </p><p>The Ojibwe are a people as old as stone. And they will be here forever. They will be here because they are part of a much larger story of their own weaving&#x2014;a story foretold by their ancestors that is lived by all those who travel the good road. </p><p>And so the story begins.</p>Thomas Peacock, a member of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, is an associate professor of education at the University of Minnesota Duluth, where he teachaes educational leadership.

Readers waited with bated breath for each new article and book he wrote. During his career, Halliburton climbed the Matterhorn, nearly fell out of his plane while shooting the first aerial photographs of Mount Everest, and became the first person to swim the full length of the Panama Canal.<br><br>With his matinee idol looks, the Tennessee native was a media darling in an era of optimism and increased social openness. But as the Great Depression and looming war pushed America toward social conservatism, Halliburton more actively worked to hide his homosexuality, burnishing his image as a masculine trailblazer. No middle ground existed regarding Halliburton&#x2014;he was either adored or abhorred. Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald called the Princeton graduate a poseur, a symbol of nouveau riche depravity. But most found his daredevil persona irresistible.<br><br>As chronicled in <i>American Daredevil</i>, Halliburton harnessed the media of his day to gain and maintain a widespread following long before our age of the twenty-four-hour news cycle, and thus became the first adventure journalist. And during the darkest hours of the Great Depression, Halliburton did something remarkable: he inspired generations of authors, journalists, and everyday people who dreamed of fame and glory to explore the world.<br></p><p><b>Cathryn J.

He is journeying with a trade caravan bound for Lhasa when a detour brings them to a valley hidden between mountain passes. On the icy planks of a wooden bridge, a monk sits in contemplation.

The dead monk, Li Du soon learns, was a reclusive painter. According to the family, his bizarre suicide is not surprising, given his obsession with the demon world.

He explains everything readers need to know about microscopes, but beginners anxious to try one out for the first time may lack the patience to plow through more than 70 pages of information on the equipment itself before doing any observing. In frequently technical terms, the author explains the different features available on microscopes, what each part does, and how to select and upgrade equipment, and provides a list of manufacturers and suppliers. An extensive section on optics covers properties of lenses, optical geometry, and the path of a light ray through a microscope. The section dealing with illumination includes tips on photomicrography (taking photographs through a microscope) and using super-8 cameras and camcorders to record through microscopes. After instructions on measuring and drawing images comes the part on preparing specimens for viewing and observing plants, animals, and aquatic microorganisms. With writing that is precise and clear, but hardly scintillating, and excellent-quality full-color diagrams and photos, this book will be perfect for advanced hobbyists or high school students involved in science projects.<br><i>Jeffrey A.

The present took precedence over that future. I spent every day recovering from two surgeries and six months of chemotherapy&#x2015;necessary evils to combat the greater evil of cancer. Knowing I must, I fought to create Unfettered from nothing. I gave little thought to a future in publishing, of writing, or even what the next day could bring.<br><br>Now, seven years later, I look back fondly at that time, remembering how my author friends rallied to my banner. They did so again with <em>Unfettered II</em>, to raise money for others in similar dire straits. Now the publication of <em>Unfettered III</em> continues that mission. These authors contribute works of the fantastic because they believe in the power of our geek community making a difference. In short, they believe in you, the reader. It warms my heart to no end.<br><br>But as I sit here writing this introduction, I am reminded that the true power of these anthologies resides within their pages&#x2015;great stories written by authors at the top of their game. And <em>Unfettered III</em> has both, no doubt. I never thought one day I&#x2019;d publish a Shannara tale. Or a Dune entry. Or any part of the Wheel of Time, let alone a novella-sized Perrin story. Or powerful new contributions featuring gorgeously wrought prose from writers like Seanan McGuire, Callie Bates, and Naomi Novik. Or grimdark by Anna Smith Spark, Anna Stephens, and Mark Lawrence. The list goes on and on. I am humbled by <em>Unfettered III</em>. I think you are in for one helluva read!<br><br>That is not all though. <em>Unfettered III</em> is why I keep publishing and hope to do so for many years to come. I can see that future now. These anthologies are a testament to great storytelling but more than that. It shows the character and strength of our reading community&#x2015;and our humanity. We rise to help others when they are down; we fight for those in need when our needs have been met.<br><br>And magic is within the words and hearts of us all.<br><br>Shawn Speakman<br>Editor and Publisher<br>December 2018</p><h2>Landscaping 1-2-3: Regional Edition: Zones 7-10</h2><p>Specific edition for hotter climates tells gardeners everything they need to know about landscaping.</p><p></p><h2>God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism</h2><p>Examining the roots of religious extremism, the author of The Woman Who Laughed at God describes the struggle between monotheism and polytheism in the ancient world, revealing the dark side of monotheism--holy war, inquistions, crusades, and martyrdom--and the brighter side of polytheism, including its emphasis on religious liberty and diversity.</p><p>Jonathan Kirsch is a book columnist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and author of the bestselling and critically acclaimed <i>King David, Moses, The Harlot by the Side of the Road</i>, and <i>The Woman Who Laughed at God</i>. He lectures and consults widely on biblical, literary, and legal topics and is a past president of PEN Center USA West.<p>Jonathan Kirsch is a fine storyteller with a flair for rendering ancient tales relevant and appealing to modern audiences. God Against the Gods finds him in good form, retelling lively stories about the struggle of monotheists against polytheists (and vice versa) from biblical times until the fourth century A.D. when Theodosius the Great outlawed pagan worship and made the Catholic version of monotheism the Roman Empire's state religion. Admirers of the author's earlier books, including Moses: A Life, King David and The Harlot by the Side of the Road, will find much to admire here. They may also be somewhat disconcerted by the theory that these stories are intended to exemplify.</p><p> In brief, Kirsch argues that monotheism -- the belief "that only a single deity is worthy of worship for the simple reason that only a single deity exists" -- is responsible for three millennia of religious intolerance and persecution, up to and including the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Those events he terms "only the most recent example of the violence that men and women are inspired to commit against their fellow human beings by their true belief in the Only True God." By comparison with exclusivist monotheism, Kirsch thinks that tolerant polytheism gets a bad rap. "At the heart of polytheism is an open-minded and easygoing approach to religious belief and practice," he asserts, the opposite of monotheism's dangerous "tendency to regard one's own rituals and practices as the only proper way to worship the one true god."</p><p> The argument is problematic, but not entirely specious. There is a connection between the fourth-century Christian extremists who destroyed the Serapeum, the most beautiful pagan temple in Alexandria, and the 20th-century Muslim extremists who blew up irreplaceable Buddhist statues in Afghanistan. But what connects these events is a certain kind of violent rigorism, not monotheism itself. The author seems to think that one thing leads naturally to another (thus, the alleged "tendency" of monotheists to become brutally intolerant) -- but this begs a vital question. Some monotheists brand people who do not share their particular beliefs evil and seek to destroy them. Others are inspired by the idea of one God to conceive of one human family, related by ties of love and responsibility. The unasked question is this: Under what circumstances do we get one form of monotheism rather than the other? What makes Torquemada Torquemada, and Pope John XXIII John XXIII?</p><p> The question is difficult, but it requires an answer. Avoiding it makes it seem that beliefs alone cause violence, when it seems pretty clear that they do not -- that the behavior of a figure like Theodosius the Great or Osama bin Laden cannot be explained on the basis of Roman Catholicism or Islamic Wahhabism alone. One needs to account not only for religious beliefs but for their context: the multiple social, political, and psychological factors that, linked with theological doctrines, incline a person to act either like a seeker of peace or a violent avenger. Kirsch's tales -- especially the late-Roman stories of Constantine the Great and Julian, called "the Apostate" -- are well researched and well told, but one searches in vain for the contextual analysis that might explain Constantine's attempt to impose an orthodox Trinitarian doctrine on the Church or Julian's quixotic effort to revivify the fading Olympian deities. </p><p>Choosing not to focus on such questions produces another problem, as well: It weakens the historical argument in the same way that not looking at "uncomfortable" cases can weaken a legal brief. God Against the Gods offers very little information about tolerant or universalist monotheists; and when it comes to the polytheists, the author tends to explain any intolerance away. (For example: "Whether the gruesome accounts of Christian martyrdom are works of history or works of propaganda . . . is still an open question.") Kirsch is no doubt right to condemn the smear tactics that early Christian apologists used against the "pagans," which involved accusing them unjustly of engaging in ritual orgies, child sacrifice and the stupidest sort of idolatry (i.e., confusing the representation of a god with the god himself). Even so, he tends to identify polytheism with the most civilized traditions of the ancient world while focusing on monotheism at its most uncivilized.</p><p> All this being said, Kirsch has written a highly readable book about a topic well worth pondering. My advice to the reader is to put his theory aside in order to concentrate on the stories themselves, which point to a richer, more complex reality. For example, Kirsch notes that by the third and fourth centuries A.D. many nominal polytheists in Rome and Greece were proclaiming their belief in a single, omnipotent Supreme Being. Constantine himself went from the worship of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, to Christian worship of the One God, which was ritually solemnized on Sun-day. Similarly, as the great historian of late antiquity Peter Brown has observed, late Roman attitudes toward sex and the family were changing in what might seem a "Christian" direction even before Christianity had become a major force for change in the Empire.</p><p> And what of the Arian/Trinitarian controversies of the same period, which involved attempts by Christian leaders to account for the multiple nature of their unitary God? Despite the differences between monotheists and polytheists, it appears that there were social forces impelling both sets of believers to move in similar directions. It is a pity that Kirsch fails to shed more light on the relationship between religious beliefs and their social context. Doing so might help us identify the forces that continue to drive some people to kill in the name of God. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Richard E.

Exploring the bridge occupies most of his days. But at night there are his dreams. Dreams in which desperate men drive sealed carriages across barren mountains to a bizarre rendezvous; an illiterate barbarian storms an enchanted tower under a stream of verbal abuse; and broken men walk forever over bridges without end, taunted by visions of a doomed sexuality.<br>Lying in bed unconscious after an accident wouldn't be much fun, you'd think. Oh yes? It depends who and what you've left behind.<br>Which is the stranger reality, day or night? Frequently hilarious and consistently disturbing, THE BRIDGE is a novel of outrageous contrasts, constructed chaos and elegant absurdities.</p><p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. He gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels. Iain Banks died in June 2013.Orr, the otherwise unnamed protagonist of this Pynchonesque novel, is a successful Scottish engineer who's a bit fed up with life: his work doesn't really interest him anymore; years of doping and boozing have dulled him; his girlfriend has other lovers (he does too, but he would rather she was monogamous). Then one evening he crashes his classic Jaguar into a parked MG. The aftermath is coma and months of amnesiac trance, a condition that Orr apparently comes to prefer. The reader, however, only understands all this towards the end of the novel. Virtually the whole of the narrative consists of Orr's trauma-induced hallucinations. The bridge of the title is a fantastically ramifying construct in Orr's brain resembling an outer-space city in a science fiction movie. Banks's ( The Player of Games ) novel is satire, and its target turns out to be the British Isles' equivalent of American "yuppies." Deploying a wide range of stylistic devices, the narrative condemns fiercely an overly mechanistic society and its self-referential ethos. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Daredevil 7</h2><p>The Serpent Society has been buying off the New York justice system and using it to their own sinister means.

He gives up a &#39;good job&#39; in advertising to work part-time in a bookshop, giving him more time to write. But he slides instead into a self-induced poverty that destroys his creativity and his spirit. Only Rosemary, ever-faithful Rosemary, has the strength to challenge his commitment to his chosen way of life. Through the character of Gordon Comstock, Orwell reveals his own disaffection with the society he once himself renounced. Enlivened with vivid autobiographical detail, George Orwell&#39;s Keep the Aspidistra Flying is a tragically witty account of the struggle to escape from a materialistic existence, with an introduction by Peter Davison in Penguin Modern Classics.</p><p>London, 1936. Gordon Comstock has declared war on the money god; and Gordon is losing the war. Nearly 30 and "rather moth-eaten already," a poet whose one small book of verse has fallen "flatter than any pancake," Gordon has given up a "good" job and gone to work in a bookshop at half his former salary. Always broke, but too proud to accept charity, he rarely sees his few friends and cannot get the virginal Rosemary to bed because (or so he believes), "If you have no money ... women won't love you." On the windowsill of Gordon's shabby rooming-house room is a sickly but unkillable aspidistra--a plant he abhors as the banner of the sort of "mingy, lower-middle-class decency" he is fleeing in his downward flight. In <i>Keep the Aspidistra Flying</i>, George Orwell has created a darkly compassionate satire to which anyone who has ever been oppressed by the lack of brass, or by the need to make it, will all too easily relate. He etches the ugly insanity of what Gordon calls "the money-world" in unflinching detail, but the satire has a second edge, too, and Gordon himself is scarcely heroic. In the course of his misadventures, we become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is no solution at all--that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system, he has become something of a monster himself. Orwell keeps both of his edges sharp to the very end--a "happy" ending that poses tough questions about just how happy it really is. That the book itself is not sour, but constantly fresh and frequently funny, is the result of Orwell's steady, unsentimental attention to the telling detail; his dry, quiet humor; his fascination with both the follies and the excellences of his characters; and his courageous refusal to embrace the comforts of any easy answer. <i>--Daniel Hintzsche</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Reaper&#39;s Property (Ellora&#39;s Cave Moderne)</h2><p>Marie doesn't need a complication like Horse.

She is a former reporter for <i>Forbes</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and author of <i>The Portrait of Dr. Gachet</i>.In this vividly narrated and highly informative study, Saltzman (<i>The Portrait of Dr. Gachet</i>), a former reporter for <i>Forbes</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, examines American collectors like Henry Clay Frick and J. Pierpont Morgan who developed America's great Old Master collections, like those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Banker and railroad magnate Henry Marquand gave 50 Old Masters to the Met, among them Vermeer's <i>Young Woman with a Water Pitcher</i>. Marquand believed in the museum's capacity to educate the public, while Gardner and Morgan modeled themselves after Renaissance patrons. A Gainsborough and Raphael were among Morgan's cultural conquests in a vast, encyclopedic collecting project. Gardner's passion for Italian Renaissance art and her complicated relationship with Renaissance specialist Bernard Berenson, who arranged for the acquisition of the most important work in her collection, Titian's <i>Rape of Europa</i>, is one of the book's highlights. Saltzman deftly demonstrates that the often highly competitive process and volatile acquisition of cultural capital by dealers and their eager employers gives fascinating and important insight into the often fraught fusion of culture and commodity that built world-class American collections.

A minor role in the trial of a senator entangles him in the machinations of Silius Italicus and Paccius Africanus ? two real-life lawyers at the top of their trade.

Once aboard, his adventures step into high gear and he meticulously maps, charts, and illustrates his exploits, documenting mythical wormholes in the Midwest, the urban phenomenon of "rims," and the pleasures of McDonald&#x2019;s, among other things.

A secret family history found within his luggage tells the story of T.S.'s ancestors and their long-ago passage west, offering profound insight into the family he left behind and his role within it. As T.S. reads he discovers the sometimes shadowy boundary between fact and fiction and realizes that, for all his analytical rigor, the world around him is a mystery.<br><br> All that he has learned is tested when he arrives at the capital to claim his prize and is welcomed into science&#x2019;s inner circle.

How do you depict how it feels to first venture out on your own? Is there a definitive way to communicate the ebbs and tides of heartbreak, loss, loneliness, love? These are the questions that strike at the core of this very special debut. <p></p> <p> <strong><i>The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet</i>: The Lost Images</strong> <br><i>by Reif Larsen</i></p><p> I initially wrote a draft of <i>The Selected Works</i> without any accompanying illustrations. After reaching the end, I still had that tingly feeling that usually means something is missing, and so I thought about it for awhile and realized that in order to really understand T.S., we actually need to see his drawings laid out on the page. T.S. was most comfortable in the exploding diagram or the annotation or the bitchin&#x2019; bar graph; this marginal material was where he would often let down his guard and reveal something he wouldn&#x2019;t otherwise in the main text. </p><p> As soon as you include that first image in the margin, however, you've positioned yourself on a slippery slope, as suddenly there's this temptation to illustrate every single detail in the novel. Particularly with a digressive character like T.S., I found that I had to be very selective about what I wanted to show. What is not shown is as important as what is shown. In addition, many of the images in this book are not direct illustrations like might you see in other books&#x2014;as in, "let me tell you about x and now here is a picture of x." Instead of a direct one-to-one correspondence, there's a satellite-like relationship between the text and the image, a kind of graphical parallelism. T.S. will talk about his suspicion of the adult male and then include a chart of male-pattern baldness, and it is through these somewhat disparate leaps between text and image, between the main story and the marginalia, that we begin to soak in T.S.'s habits of mind. </p><p> Sometimes I would include an image and then realize that I could now erase a piece of text, as the image was performing the work of that text, and often performing it in subtler ways. On page 67, for instance, there's a diagram of the patterns of cross&#x2013;talk at the dinner table. Before this image came along, I had a whole elaborate explanation of T.S.'s difficulties talking to his Father at the head of the table, but this became redundant with the diagram; the visual shows it much more elegantly. </p><p> And then there were cases where I put in an image only to figure out after awhile that it just wasn't working. In honor of T.S.'s tendency to categorize everything, I've chosen five of these "lost images," each representative of a different reason for ending up on the cutting-room floor. </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Reason 1: NO ROOM!</b><br> Image: <i>The Thrushing of Dr. Clair&#x2019;s Hairbrush (as seen through the keyhole).</i></td></tr> <tr> <td></td><td>This was an example of the illustration just not fitting in the margins. We thought a lot about the dimensions of the book&#x2014;a size that felt novelistic but also allowed for enough width to give the margins breathing room. So a couple of images just got the axe. I like this one, though, and was sad to see it go. I now use it in one of my slideshow/readings.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Reason 2: CUT THE STRING, LOSE THE KITE</b><br> Image: <i>Donkey/Dolphin/Dog</i></td></tr> <tr> <td></td><td>In an old draft, T.S. fantasized about his impending fame as he rode the freight train out East:<p> "I took a couple of stereoscopic photos, promising myself that when I got to Washington I would look into the possibility of arranging an exhibit on the eye and stereoscopic vision using the panoramas of the West. The West seemed a good a place as any to point out that our world was in three dimensions. For a brief moment, I was intensely excited again about the possibility of exhibitions like this one; exhibitions on x-ray vision and time travel; the sturdiness of human bones; the intelligence of dogs and dolphins and donkeys."</p><p> I wanted to just gesture at one of these imaginary drawings, and I like how in this very seventh-grade bar graph there is no label on the y-axis, just a vague quantification of "intelligence." But the original line was cut... I didn't want T.S. musing about his fame just yet, and so went the vague bar graph. Cut the string, lose the kite. </p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Reason 3: NOT DOING THE WORK</b><br> Image: <i>Newton Notwen, the Turtle</i></td></tr> <tr><td></td><td>In Chapter 7, T.S. turns to Newton's laws of conservation to help give him some theoretical sturdiness during his cross-country adventure. I originally had a sidebar here about Newton Notwen, T.S.&#x2019;s unfortunate turtle:<p> "I still respected Newton immensely even if he did look a little like a child pornographer in his portraits. I had even named my first pet turtle after him: Newton Notwen, a perfect palindrome, because Newton Notwen had a tiny head that looked a lot like his tail if you squinted your eyes. Perhaps because of this reciprocal anatomy, NN died after only a week of living in the kiddie pool on our deck, although it could also have been because Layton shot him."</p><p> I made the tough decision to cut this because I thought it was too jokey jokey and wasn't doing enough for the scene. </p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Reason 4: TOO ILLUSTRATIVE</b><br> Image: <i>The Valero Workstation</i></td></tr> <tr><td> </td></tr> <tr><td>This illustration originally opened chapter 8, but I felt like it was qualitatively different than many of the other drawings in that it was almost too illustrative. It was the kind of illustration you might find in a graphic novel, where images serve a very different purpose of representation. We get the hint of the family photo, but not much else with this, and so I swapped it with the <i>Boredom Box,</i> which is ultimately more engaging, I think. </td></tr></tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Reason 5: DULLS THE ACTION</b><br> Image: <i>The Dock Cleat</i></td></tr> <tr><td></td><td>When T.S. has his confrontation with the crazed preacher in Chicago, there&#x2019;s a very tense moment of action. I originally had this diagram showing how Josiah trips over a dock cleat, but I realized the diagramming of the action actually lessened the stakes of the scene. Better to just give a couple of resonant images of the knife and the birds and then let the reader fill in the rest. The most powerful images are always those elusive mind maps that readers create in their own heads when fully immersed in a piece of literature; nothing on the page can hope to replicate their depth and intimacy.<p> And of course there were other reasons for cutting drawings: some were just lousy. I will spare you these lost images, however, as they belong in graphical pergatory. T.S. would not have approved, and let me tell you, I've learned a thing or two from Mr. Tecumseh Sparrow. </p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p></p>Reif Larsen&#39;s first novel, The Selected Works of T.

The text is not arranged for report writing. Rather, it is organized in a way that will challenge children to use their hands and brains. For instance, after describing the geography of ancient Greece, children are asked to make a model using four rocks and modeling clay, and ponder this question: "Does the land also change and shape the people who live on it? Are whole civilizations shaped by the land on which they live?" The information--including bits about the history, art, religion, and more--is presented in an informal, breezy style, and set down in brief paragraphs scattered across the pages. Illustrations, including some contemporary cartoons, are plentiful. The least successful part of the book is the retellings of mythology, which are so truncated that their power is drastically reduced. However, the book should still give students a good overview, and it offers many good ideas for teachers. <i>Susan Dove Lempke</i>Grade 4-7-What at first glance appears to be yet another how-to project book is actually a clever title that encourages learning and creativity. Hart and Mantell blend information about the Greeks with suggestions for activities. They offer starting points for various projects rather than step-by-step instructions. Activities involve poetry, drama, pottery, architecture, sculpture, food, and even a suggestion for an "Odyssey Rap" featuring Homer and the Homettes. Each page contains several blocks of text and pictures on related topics. The illustrations combine cartoons of modern children with drawings, photographs, and reproductions of ancient statuary and artifacts. The project ideas have a wider scope than Susan Purdy and Cass Sandak's "Civilization Project Books" series (Watts; o.p.). The resource list includes many titles that are out of print, and no Web sites are included. These are minor weaknesses, however, in a book that will be beneficial to students studying ancient history.<br><i>Elizabeth Stumpf, Clearfield Middle School, PA </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ready Player One (Random House Large Print)</h2><p><p><b>#1&nbsp;<i>NEW YORK TIMES&nbsp;</i>BESTSELLER&nbsp;</b>�&nbsp;<b>Now a major motion picture directed by Steven Spielberg.</b><br><br> <b>&#x201c;Enchanting . . .&nbsp;<i>Willy Wonka&nbsp;</i>meets&nbsp;<i>The Matrix</i>.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>USA Today&nbsp;</i>�&nbsp;&#x201c;As one adventure leads expertly to the next, time simply evaporates.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br> <i>A world at stake.

People can plug into OASIS to play, go to school, earn money, and even meet other people (or at least they can meet their avatars), and for protagonist Wade Watts it certainly beats passing the time in his grim, poverty-stricken real life. Along with millions of other world-wide citizens, Wade dreams of finding three keys left behind by James Halliday, the now-deceased creator of OASIS and the richest man to have ever lived. The keys are rumored to be hidden inside OASIS, and whoever finds them will inherit Halliday&#x2019;s fortune. But Halliday has not made it easy. And there are real dangers in this virtual world. Stuffed to the gills with action, puzzles, nerdy romance, and 80s nostalgia, this high energy cyber-quest will make geeks everywhere feel like they were separated at birth from author Ernest Cline.<em>--Chris Schluep</em></p> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Daniel H. Wilson on <em>Ready Player One</em> by Earnest Cline</strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Daniel H. Wilson</strong> is the </em>New York Times<em> best-selling author of</em> Robopocalypse. <p>I dare you not to fall in love with <em>Ready Player One</em>. And I mean <em>head over heels</em> in love--the way you fall for someone who is smart, feisty, and who can effortlessly finish your favorite movie lines, music lyrics, or literature quotes before they come out of your mouth.</p> <p><em>Ready Player One</em> expertly mines a copious vein of 1980s pop culture, catapulting the reader on a light-speed adventure in an advanced but backward-looking future.</p> <p>The story is set in a near-term future in which the new, new form of the Internet is a realistic virtual multi-verse called the OASIS. Most human interaction takes place via goggles and gloves in millions of unique worlds, including the boring (and free) &#x201c;public education&#x201d; world from which our teenage protagonist must escape.</p> <p>Our unlikely hero is an overweight trailer park kid who goes by Wade Watts in real life, and &#x201c;Parzival&#x201d; to his best friends and mortal enemies--all of whom he interacts with virtually. Just like the Arthurian knight that is his namesake, young Wade is on a quest for an incredible treasure guarded by mythical creatures. Specifically, the creator of the OASIS and richest man on the planet, James Halliday, stipulated in his will that his fortune be given to the first person who can find an &#x201c;Easter egg&#x201d; hidden somewhere in the OASIS. The catch? Every devilishly complex clue on this treasure hunt is rooted in an intimate knowledge of 1980s pop culture.</p> <p>This leaves the people of the future hilariously <em>obsessed</em> with every aspect of the 1980s. The setup is particularly brilliant, because Ernie Cline seems to have a laser-beam knowledge of (and warm, fuzzy love for) every pop song, arcade game, and giant robot produced in the last thirty years. Seriously, this is a guy who owns and regularly drives a 1982 DeLorean that has been mocked up to look exactly like the time-traveling car in <em>Back to the Future</em>, complete with a glowing flux capacitor.</p> <p>But <em>Ready Player One</em> isn&#x2019;t just a fanboy&#x2019;s wet dream. Real villains are lurking, threatening our hero with death in their ruthless hunt for the treasure. Worse, these corporate baddies are posers with no love for the game &#x2013; they have movie dialogue piped in via radio earpieces, use bots to cheat at arcade games like JOUST, and don&#x2019;t hesitate to terrorize or murder people in the real world to achieve their aims inside the OASIS.</p> <p>As the book climaxes, a mega-battle unfolds with sobering life-or-death stakes, yet soldiered entirely by exciting and downright fun pop-culture icons. The bad guys are piloting a ferocious Mechagodzilla. Our good guy has to leave his X-Wing fighter aboard his private flotilla so that he can pilot an authentic Ultraman recreation. And how do you not grin when someone dons a pair of virtual Chuck Taylor All Stars that bestow the power of flight?</p> <p>Cline is fearless and he lets his imagination soar, yet this pop scenery could easily come off as so much fluff. Instead, Cline keeps the stakes high throughout, and the epic treasure hunt structure (complete with an evolving high-score list) keeps the action intense. The plot unfolds with constant acceleration, never slowing down or sagging in the middle, to create a thrilling ride with a fulfilling ending.</p> <p>Best of all, the book captures the aura of the manifold worlds it depicts. If <em>Ready Player One</em> were a living room, it would be wood-panelled. If it were shoes, it would be high-tops. And if it were a song, well, it would have to be <em>Eye of the Tiger</em>.</p> <p>I really, really loved it.</p> <p><em>-- Daniel H. Wilson</em></p> <p><strong>Questions for Ernest Cline, Author of <em>Ready Player One</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> So it seems you&#x2019;re a bit of a pop-culture buff. In your debut novel <em>Ready Player One</em> you incorporate literally hundreds of pop culture references, many of them in ways that are integral to the book&#x2019;s plot. What&#x2019;s the first thing you remember geeking out over?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> <em>Sesame Street</em> and the Muppets. I thought Jim Henson ruled the universe. I even thought it was pretty cool that I shared my first name with a muppet. Until the first day of kindergarten, when I quickly learned that "Ernie" was not a cool name to have. That was about the time I segued into my next childhood obsession, <em>Star Wars</em>.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Like the book&#x2019;s hero, you possess a horrifyingly deep knowledge of a terrifyingly broad swathe of culture, ranging from John Hughes movies to super-obscure Japanese animation to 8-bit videogames to science-fiction and fantasy literature to role-playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. What the heck is wrong with you?! How do you have so much time on your hands?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Well, I&#x2019;m raising a toddler now, so I don&#x2019;t have as much time to geek out as I used to. I think I amassed a lot of that knowledge during my youth. Like most geeks, I was a sponge for all kinds of movies, TV shows, cartoons, and video games. Then as an adult, I worked at a long series of low paying tech support jobs that allowed me to surf the Internet all day, and I spent a lot of my cubicle time looking up obscure pop culture minutiae from my childhood while I waited for people to reboot their PCs. Of course, I spent most of my off hours geeking out, too. Luckily, all those hours can now be classified as "research" for my novel.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> You&#x2019;re stranded on an island and you can only take one movie with you. What is it?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Easy! <em>The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition</em>. (Can I take all of the DVD Extras and Making of Documentaries, too?)</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> You&#x2019;re given free tickets and back stage passes to one concert (artist can be living or dead)- who is it and why?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Are we talking about time travel back to a specific concert in the past here? Because it would be pretty cool to stand on the roof of Apple Records and watch the Beatles jam up there. But my favorite rock band that&#x2019;s still together is RUSH, and I just bought tickets to see them this June!</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Favorite book of all time.</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> That&#x2019;s an impossible question! I could maybe give you three favorites: <em>Snow Crash</em> by Neal Stephenson, <em>Galapagos</em> by Kurt Vonnegut, and <em>The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> by Douglas Adams.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Best failed TV show pilot available on Youtube?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> The unaired Batgirl pilot starring Yvonne Craig.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Favorite episode of Cowboy Bebop?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> &#x201c;Ganymede Elegy.&#x201d; Or maybe &#x201c;Boogie Woogie Feng Shui.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> What&#x2019;s the first arcade game you ever played? What&#x2019;s your favorite?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> I was deflowered by <em>Space Invaders</em>. My all time favorite coin-op game was probably <em>Black Tiger</em>.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Your idea of the perfect day...</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Play Black Tiger. Then go see <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em> at the Alamo Drafthouse with Kurt Russell and John Carpenter doing a live Q&amp;A afterwards. When I get home that night, I accidentally invent a cheap abundant clean energy source that saves human civilization. I celebrate by staying up late to watch old <em>Ultraman</em> episodes with my daughter (who loves <em>Ultraman</em> even more than I do).</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> True or False. We hear you own a DeLorean and that you plan on tricking it out to be a time-travelling, Ghostbusting, Knight-Rider car.</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> False. I actually plan on tricking it out to be a time-traveling Ghostbusting Knight Riding Jet Car. It&#x2019;s going to have both a Flux Capacitor and an Oscillation Overthruster in it, so that my Delorean can travel through time AND solid matter. My personalized plates are ECTO88, just like a DeLorean that appears in my book.</p> <p>(I&#x2019;m so glad that you asked this question, because now I can justify buying the car as a "promotional tool" for my book. Everyone reading this is a witness! My DeLorean is helping me promote my book! The fact that I&#x2019;ve wanted one since I was ten years old is totally irrelevant!)</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Speaking of DeLoreans: biggest plot hole in the <em>Back to The Future</em> Films?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> The <em>Back to The Future</em> Trilogy is perfect and contains no plot holes! Except for the plot hole inherent in nearly all time travel films: The planet Earth is moving through space at an immense speed at all times. So if you travel back in time, you are traveling to a time when the Earth was in a different location, and you and your time machine would appear somewhere out in deep space. For a time machine to be useful, it also needs to be able to teleport you to wherever the Earth was/is at your destination time.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> But there are two DeLoreans in 1885--why doesn&#x2019;t Doc dig out the one he buried in a cave for Marty to find in 1955 and use the gasoline from it to get the other DeLorean up to 88mph?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Doc would have drained the gas tank before he stored a car for 80 years, so there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any gas.

It is most unusual for a trained philosopher to give us his insight, as Colin McGinn does here, into six of Shakespeare's greatest plays&#x2014;<em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>King Lear</em>, and <em>The Tempest</em>.</p><p>In his brilliant commentary, McGinn explores Shakespeare's philosophy of life and illustrates how he was influenced, for example, by the essays of Montaigne that were translated into English while Shakespeare was writing. In addition to chapters on the great plays, there are also essays on Shakespeare and gender and his plays from the aspects of psychology, ethics, and tragedy. </p><p>As McGinn says about Shakespeare, "There is not a sentimental bone in his body. He has the curiosity of a scientist, the judgement of a philosopher, and the soul of a poet." McGinn relates the ideas in the plays to the later philosophers such as David Hume and the modern commentaries of critics such as Harold Bloom. The book is an exhilarating reading experience, especially at a time when a new audience has opened up for the greatest writer in English.</p></p><p><p>Colin McGinn was educated at Oxford University. The author of sixteen previous books, including <em>The Making of a Philosopher</em>, he has written for the <em>London Review of Books</em>, <em>The New Republic</em>, the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, and other publications. He has taught philosophy at University College of London, Oxford, and Rutgers University, and is a distinguished professor of philosophy at the University of Miami.</p>Shakespeare's famous phrase "All the world's a stage/ And all the men and women merely players" reflects a common sense of the self shared by many philosophers. So begins McGinn's project of tracing Shakespeare's philosophy through six of his great plays, while arguing that the great English bard can be fairly regarded as a philosopher. Without seeming at all dusty, the book examines Shakespeare in relation to Hume, Wittgenstein and such major philosophical questions as nothingness, language, causation and the nature of knowledge. McGinn makes a credible case that the essays of Montaigne as well as skepticism and naturalism had a clear influence on Shakespeare's writings, bringing unexpected freshness to topics that are well-worn in high school curriculums. Most interesting is McGinn's earnest delight in rediscovering Shakespeare's characters, such as the tragic Cordelia and the indecisive Hamlet. McGinn's gift, aside from his clear and beautiful prose, is in recognizing Shakespeare's genius in creating true and recognizable people, who ring as true to modern audiences as they did to his contemporaries. "He told us how the world looks from the perspective of itself. And the world never looked the same again." This conclusion implies that just as Shakespeare the playwright still moves his audiences, so, too, can Shakespeare the philosopher. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond&#x2019;s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist. For incredible suspense, unexpected thrills, and extraordinary danger, nothing can beat James Bond in his inaugural adventure.</p><p><p>Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p><b>1. THE SECRET AGENT</b></p> <p>The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling&#x2014;a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension&#x2014;becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.</p> <p>James Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on the knowledge. This helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes.</p> <p>He shifted himself unobtrusively away from the roulette he had been playing and went to stand for a moment at the brass rail which surrounded breast-high the top table in the salle privee.</p> <p>Le Chiffre was still playing and still, apparently, winning. There was an untidy pile of flecked hundred-mille plaques in front of him. In the shadow of his thick left arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow ones worth half a million francs each.</p> <p>Bond watched the curious, impressive profile for a time, and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and moved away.</p> <p>The barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as your chin and the caissier, who is generally nothing more than a minor bank clerk, sits on a stool and dips into his piles of notes and plaques. These are ranged on shelves. They are on a level, behind the protecting barrier, with your groin. The caissier has a cosh and a gun to protect him, and to heave over the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and get out of the casino through the passages and doors would be impossible. And the caissiers generally work in pairs.</p> <p>Bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of hundred thousand and then the sheaves often thousand franc notes. With another part of his mind, he had a vision of tomorrow's regular morning meeting of the casino committee.</p> <p>'Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played his usual game. Miss Fairchild made a million in an hour and then left. She executed three "bancos" of Monsieur Le Chiffre within an hour and then left. She played with coolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one million two at roulette. He was playing the maximum on the first and last dozens. He was lucky. Then the Englishman, Mister Bond, increased his winnings to exactly three million over the two days. He was playing a progressive system on red at table five. Duclos, the chef de partie, has the details. It seems that he is persevering and plays in maximums. He has luck. His nerves seem good. On the soiree, the chemin-de-fer won x, the baccarat won y and the roulette won z. The boule, which was again badly frequented, still makes its expenses.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur Xavier.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur le President.'</p> <p>Or something like that, thought Bond as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle privee and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.</p> <p>And the casino committee would balance its books and break up to its homes or cafes for lunch.</p> <p>As for robbing the caisse, in which Bond himself was not personally concerned, but only interested, he reflected that it would take ten good men, that they would certainly have to kill one or two employees, and that anyway you probably couldn't find ten non-squeal killers in France, or in any other country for the matter of that.</p> <p>As he gave a thousand francs to the vestiaire and walked down the steps of the casino. Bond made up his mind that Le Chiffre would in no circumstances try to rob the caisse and he put the contingency out of his mind. Instead he explored his present physical sensations. He felt the dry, uncomfortable gravel under his evening shoes, the bad, harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his arms. He could feel his eyes filling their sockets. The front of his face, his nose and antrum, were congested. He breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses and his wits. He wanted to know if anyone had searched his room since he had left it before dinner.</p> <p>He walked across the broad boulevard and through the gardens to the Hotel Splendide. He smiled at the concierge who gave him his key&#x2014;No 45 on the first floor&#x2014;and took the cable.</p> <p>It was from Jamaica and read:</p> <p>KINGSTONJA XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXX<br> BOND SPLENDIDE ROYALE-LES-EAUX SEINE<br> INFERIEURE HAVANA CIGAR PRODUCTION ALL<br> CUBAN FACTORIES 1915 TEN MILLION REPEAT<br> TEN MILLION STOP HOPE THIS FIGURE YOU<br> REQUIRE REGARDS.<br> </p> <p>DASILVA<br> </p> <p>This meant that ten million francs was on the way to him. It was the reply to a request Bond had sent that afternoon through Paris to his headquarters in London asking for more funds. Paris had spoken to London where Clements, the head of Bond's department, had spoken to M, who had smiled wryly and told 'The Broker' to fix it with the Treasury.</p> <p>Bond had once worked in Jamaica and his cover on the Royale assignment was that of a very rich client of Messrs Caffery, the principal import and export firm of Jamaica. So he was being controlled through Jamaica, through a taciturn man who was head of the picture desk on the Daily Gleaner, the famous newspaper of the Caribbean.</p> <p>This man on the Gleaner, whose name was Fawcett, had been bookkeeper for one of the leading turtle fisheries on the Cayman Islands. One of the men from the Caymans who had volunteered on the outbreak of war, he had ended up as a Paymaster's clerk in a small Naval Intelligence organization in Malta. At the end of the war, when, with a heavy heart, he was due to return to the Caymans, he was spotted by the section of the Secret Service concerned with the Caribbean. He was strenuously trained in photography and in some other arts and, with the quiet connivance of an influential man in Jamaica, found his way to the picture desk of the Gleaner.</p> <p>In the intervals between sifting photographs submitted by the great agencies&#x2014;Keystone, Wide-World, Universal, INP, and Reuter-Photo&#x2014;he would get peremptory instructions by telephone from a man he had never met to carry out certain simple operations 1 requiring nothing but absolute discretion, speed, and accuracy. For these occasional services he received twenty pounds a month paid into his account with the Royal Bank of Canada by a fictitious relative in England.</p> <p>Fawcett's present assignment was to relay immediately to Bond, full rates, the text of messages which he received at home by telephone from his anonymous contact. He had been told by this contact that nothing he would be asked to send would arouse the suspicion of the Jamaican post office. So he was not surprised to find himself suddenly appointed string correspondent for the 'Maritime Press and Photo Agency', with press-collect facilities to France and England, on a further monthly retainer of ten pounds.</p> <p>He felt secure and encouraged, had visions of a BEM and made the first payment on a Morris Minor. He also bought a green eye-shade which he had long coveted and which helped him to impose his personality on the picture desk.</p> <p>Some of this background to his cable passed through Bond's mind. He was used to oblique control and rather liked it. He felt it feather-bedded him a little, allowed him to give or take an hour or two in his communications with M. He knew that this was probably a fallacy, that probably there was another member of the Service at Royale-les-Eaux who was reporting independently, but it did give the illusion that he wasn't only 150 miles across the Channel from that deadly office building near Regent's Park, being watched and judged by those few cold brains that made the whole show work. Just as Fawcett, the Cayman Islander in Kingston, knew that if he bought that Morris Minor outright instead of signing the hire-purchase agreement, someone in London would probably know and want to know where the money had come from.</p> <p>Bond read the cable twice. He tore a telegram form off the pad on the desk (why give them carbon copies?) and wrote his reply in capital letters:</p> <p>THANKS INFORMATION SHOULD SUFFICE&#x2014;BOND</p> <p>He handed this to the concierge and put the cable signed 'Dasilva' in his pocket. The employers (if any) of the concierge could bribe a copy out of the local post office, if the concierge hadn't already steamed the envelope open or read the cable upside down in Bond's hands.</p> <p>He took his key and said good night and turned to the stairs, shaking his head at the liftman. Bond knew what an obliging danger-signal a lift could be. He didn't expect anyone to be moving on the first floor, but he preferred to be prudent.</p> <p>Walking quietly up on the balls of his feet, he regretted the hubris of his reply to M via Jamaica. As a gambler he knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a capital. Anyway, M probably wouldn't let him have any more. He shrugged his shoulders and turned off the stairs into the corridor and walked softly to the door of his room.</p> <p>Bond knew exactly where the switch was and it was with one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the door full open, the light on and a gun in his hand. The safe, empty room sneered at him. He ignored the half-open door of the bathroom and, locking himself in, he turned up the bed-light and the mirror-light and threw his gun on the settee beside the window. Then he bent down and inspected one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it before dinner, wedged into the drawer of the writing-desk.</p> <p>Next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard. It appeared immaculate. He went into the bathroom, lifted the cover of the lavatory cistern and verified the level of the water against a small scratch on the copper ball-cock.</p> <p>Doing all this, inspecting these minute burglar alarms, did not make him feel foolish or self-conscious. He was a secret agent, an...</p></p><h2>The Renegades: A Charlie Hood Novel</h2><p>Patrolling a section of America&#39;s West that he finds just as untamed as those depicted in early pulp novels, Charlie Hood finds his preference for working alone overruled when he is assigned to partner with a popular county veteran whose subsequent murder reveals sinister truths behind the man&#39;s stellar reputation. 100,000 first printing.</p><p><b>T.

In those early days the museum was forever on the move. For some time it was lodged at Leighton House before settling uneasily for a period into the Victoria and Albert Museum where I was working. The archive was presided over by Alexander Schouvaloff, a legendary aristocratic figure with gleaming shoes, thick black hair brushed across his forehead and dark eyes that narrowed dramatically whenever someone spoke to him. It was rumoured that he had been recruited by Roy Strong who had then fallen out with him to such a degree that, in the Pushkin manner, Schouvaloff felt obliged to challenge him to a duel. The people I met were the deputy director Jennifer Aylmer, a grey-haired woman with bright pink lipstick who came from a well-known theatre family; and her assistant, a brilliant-looking young girl who quite dazzled me. I was still working there at closing time - after which we went out for a drink. My new friend often worked late and I would wait for her after the public had left the museum, wandering through the empty galleries and halls. It wasduring these evening promenades that I first saw Rodin's bust of Eve Fairfax.It was a bronze bust cast in the early years of the twentieth century when she was in her mid-to-late thirties. Her face fascinated me. It appeared to change subtly depending on the angle and the distance from which I looked at it. Sometimes she appeared serene, sometimes she seemed clothed in a lingering air of melancholy and her sorrowful countenance gained a strange authority. Before long the sculpture began to exert a hypnotic effect on me and I started to make enquiries about Auguste Rodin and Eve Fairfax.&nbsp;<br>On 24 February 1905 Rodin dined in London with a new benefactor Ernest Beckett (shortly to emerge, like a butterfly from its chrysalis, as the second Lord Grimthorpe). Beckett was introducing him to several members of the English aristocracy and had been involved in raising a subscription to purchase a major sculpture, his bronze <i>Saint Jean-Baptiste pr�chant</i>, for the nation. This purchase was celebrated by a banquet at the Caf� Royal which marked, in the words of Rodin's biographer Ruth Butler, 'Rodin's entrance into English Society'.A fortnight before their dinner, Beckett had written to Rodin with an enthusiasm bordering on incoherence, to say how much he was looking forward to seeing 'the bust of Miss Fairfax and I know that you work to make it a chef d'oeuvre and have heard it said that you have succeeded ... I believe that your talent is yet more grand than the great appreciation that it has recognised at last in all the world. He had commissioned the bust of Eve Fairfax in 1901 to be, it was understood, a wedding present for her - he was a widower, his young American wife having died ten years previously, after giving birth to their son. He regretted that he could not afford the twenty-two thousand francs Rodin had asked and offered ten thousand francs or a delay of a year or two instead.It seems that Rodin preferred the delay. Meanwhile, Beckett ordered a small version of Rodin's <i>The Thinker</i> and was encouraging others to contribute money to pay for his monument to Whistler in the allegorical form of a Winged Victory to be placed on Chelsea Embankment.&nbsp;<br>Visiting his studio in February 1901, Ernest Beckett had described Rodin as 'a man rather below middle height, with incisive gray blue eyes, a broad curving, downward-drooping nose, a shaggy beard, gray, with gleams of red in it'. Rodin had explained to him 'in vigorous picturesque language the sense and meaning of his great creations'. And Beckett felt himself to be 'in the presence of a man, who is not only an artist of supreme genius, but who is a poet and a philosopher as well'. What most appealed to him was the power of his sculpture - what he described as its 'full-blooded prodigal abounding force'. He called Rodin 'the Wagner of sculpture ... with new capabilities and larger powers'. In March he had sent a laudatory article to Rodin who immediately recognised a new patron.The article revealed Ernest Beckett as a man of great enthusiasms. More precisely he was a man of swiftly changing enthusiasms, a dilettante, philanderer, gambler and opportunist. He changed his name, his career, his interests and his mistresses quite regularly and on seeing Rodin's work, which made the work of other artists seem 'bound by the small, stiff, formal ideas' of the past, he sold his collection of old decorative French <i>objets d'art</i> and sixteenth-century pictures, and commissioned Rodin to execute a portrait bust of Eve Fairfax. She would be travelling to Paris, accompanied by a chaperone, to study the French language and would visit Rodin's studio carrying Beckett's letter of introduction. What he wanted was 'the head, the neck and the upper part of the shoulders, as you have done of the young French woman that so pleased me. I would also like this bust to have a pedestalfrom that same segment of marble.' Rodin's busts of men were usually done in bronze, those of women in marble - though he often worked initially with clay.The sittings, which stopped and started and went on in this intermittent fashion for over eight years, stopped almost before they had started when her chaperone was obliged to travel back to England and Eve, who as a prospective bride could not remain unaccompanied in Paris, also had to return. She eventually found other companions to escort her to Paris and the work recommenced in April. Beckett wrote to Rodin somewhat optimistically in the second week of May that he would be 'very happy to see the bust of Miss Fairfax ... [who] tells me that she will go to Paris in June in order to give you the final sittings'.From March 1901 until September 1914 one hundred and sixteen letters of Eve's to Rodin survive and twenty-five from him to her. It was 'an exceptional long period', noted Rodin's secretary Ren� Cheruy, ' ... there was a love story at the bottom of this.' Eve was in her late twenties at the beginning of the sittings. Rodin initially treated the portrait of Eve as a commission from his new patron, and the correspondence between the sculptor and his sitter was formal. But gradually, as the Rodin scholar Marion J. Hare observes, their letters 'become more personal and even intimate'. To justify spending so much time in Paris and learn some French, Eve attended a Dieu Donn� school for young ladies.Eve writes in simple French, childlike and hesitant, her limitations of vocabulary and faltering syntax seeming to hint at tentative emotions. Her letters give a sense of possibilities just out of reach, half-remembered dreams - none of which she can quite catch and make her own. Rodin, too, is restricted in what he writes - yet occasionally, for a moment, breaking free from these restrictions. It is a polite explorativeconversation from a distant age, with delicate implications: oblique and unsophisticated. But where will it lead?E.F.: I always think of you. Would you write to me?&nbsp;<br>R.: I think also that you will come one of these days and I will put myself completely at your service.&nbsp;<br>E.F.: I have been ill and the doctor tells me that I must take the electric baths ... I am so sad that I cannot come at present but it is not my fault.&nbsp;<br>R.: I am also sad to know you are ill. Alas my very dear model, you have great spirit and your body suffers from that ... I await you at the end of July ... and will be happy to greet you and to finish your beautiful and melancholy portrait.&nbsp;<br>E.F.: Your letter made me so much better and gave me courage ... it is the heart that makes the body suffer. Your great sympathy helped me a great deal ... I am always sad to say good-bye to you ... I think about you often ... I would like so much to be again in your studio ... you stimulate my heart.An undated letter to Eve from a woman friend suggests that she may have had puerperal fever. From this suggestion a rumour arose that her engagement to Ernest had come as the result of her pregnancy, but that she suffered a miscarriage (an alternative interpretation is that this happened later and signalled the end of their relationship). There is no certainty of this and little evidence in her correspondence.E.F.: I had wished to write something but could not find the French words to express all that I wished to say, thus the silence is alwayseloquent ... I am certain that the bust will be a chef d'oeuvre and I wish so much to see it again and you also grand ma�tre.&nbsp;<br>R.: Your letter full of kindly feelings towards me restores me. Yes, I am tired of my life ... Give me some letters when the inspiration takes hold of you. Your French is very good for me for it shows pluck and spirit.&nbsp;<br>E.F.: Why are you sad; that causes me much pain.&nbsp;<br>R.: Your generous cast of mind and of body, your genuine grandeur, has always touched me ... Also I am so happy to tell you now that your bust will be worthy of you ... After your departure my memories vigorously coalesced and in a moment of good fortune I succeeded ... Voil� the bust.This exchange took place during 1903 and Rodin's last letter was written on 24 December 1903. In her reply four days later, Eve does not mention the sculpture itself. The question that troubles her is, if the bust is indeed successfully completed, are the sittings completed too? And will she see Rodin again? She tells him that her heart is 'full of affection' and it makes her unhappy to think that 'I cannot see you more often'.

Taking readers into a secluded sanctuary for book lovers, and guiding us through the creation of the author's own first book, <i>Sixpence House</i> becomes a heartfelt and often hilarious meditation on what books mean to us.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Collins</b> is the author of <i>Banvard's Folly: Thirteen People Who Didn't Change the World</i>, and <i>Not Even Wrong</i>. He edits the Collins Library for McSweeney's Books, and his work has appeared in <i>New Scientist, Business 2.0</i>, and <i>Tin House</i>.</p>Hay-on-Wye, a Welsh town of 1,500, is heaven on earth for people who love books, especially old books. It has 40 bookstores, and if you can't find what you want in one of them, you can fork over 50 pence and visit the field behind the town castle, where thousands more long-forgotten books languish under a sprawling tarp. McSweeney's contributor Collins moved his wife and baby son from San Francisco to Hay a few years ago, intending to settle there. This book is Collins's account of the brief period when he organized American literature in one of the many used-book stores, contemplated and abandoned the idea of becoming a peer in the House of Lords, tried to buy an affordable house that wasn't falling apart (a problem when most of the buildings are at least a century old) and revised his first book (Banvard's Folly). Collins can be quite funny, and he pads his sophomore effort with obscure but amusing trivia (how many book lovers know that the same substance used to thicken fast-food milk shakes is an essential ingredient in paper resizing?), but it's hard to imagine anyone beyond bibliophiles and fellow Hay-lovers finding enough here to hold their attention. Witty and droll though he may be, Collins fails to give his slice-of-life story the magic it needs to transcend the genre. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sons and Daughters of God</h2><p>This new edition of a popular devotional book features a larger size and easier to read type.

An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineAll hail to octogenarian, pseudonymous Eleanor Hibbert (Victoria Holt/Jean Plaidy/Philippa Carr) on the occasion of her 30th Holt novel of romantic suspense! Though this tale of an actress's daughter and her tribulations is not up to Holt's suspenseful best, who cares? Certainly not her large following, who look forward to such as: a variety of impressive digs (here, late- 19th-century Kent, Cornwall, London, and Paris), at least two of which give the feisty heroine a shiver of apprehension and a buzz of secrets--plus a murder and a shadowy someone bent on bad business. Noelle Tremason spent an ideal childhood in London with her beloved mother--the famous, beautiful (and good) musical-comedy actress D&#x201a;sir&#x201a;e, who attracted admirers, among them wealthy Charles Claverham from Kent. Then D&#x201a;sir&#x201a;e took under her wing an orphaned, poor, aspiring actress, Lisa--who takes over as understudy when D&#x201a;sir&#x201a;e begins to suffer sick spells. Lisa also seems to want to understudy for Noelle on her secret meeting with Roderick, Charles's son. Then D&#x201a;sir&#x201a;e dies. In Noelle's agonized travels afterward, marriage is prevented by a devastating revelation; an enemy becomes a friend during a near-fatal accident in an archaeological dig; the Franco-Prussian War ends marriage possibilities in Paris; and there's a poisoning murder. Chat. Action. Chat. And a murder(s) that will out just before the final clinch and fade-out. May Hibbert/Holt keep 'em coming for the faithful following.

The story concludes with the discovery of an entire family of seahorses, shown in many sizes, gracefully posed inside a cave.

The novel is a representation of the author&#39;s own spiritual quest, transposed into fictional form, and was published posthumously in 1952. This edition is newly translated by Carol Cosman, with an afterword by Vera Daumal. Among other things, this is an allegory for the journey of life, as well as a marvellous tale in which the narrator/author, one of an intrepid company of eight, sets sail in the yacht Impossible to search for Mount Analogue, the solid, geographically located, albeit hidden, peak that reaches inexorably towards heaven - as Mount Olympus reached to the home of the Greek gods, or Mount Sinai to the presence of Yahweh. Daumal, often described as one of the most gifted literary figures in twentieth century France, died before the novel was completed, providing an uncanny one-way quality to the journey that the reader cannot help but share.</p><p>Ren� Daumal (1908-44), a follower of the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff, also studied Sanskrit, philosophy, science, mathematics, and medicine.

All professional writers, the men have met every autumn for eighteen years at the Big Arsenic Springs on the R�o Grande to fly-cast for trout and argue about life, literature, marriage, and eco-Armageddon. Their escapades reveal a spirited paean to a beautiful river gorge, and also a poignant cautionary fable about male friendship and cutthroat competition. As aging cripples them all, tragedy mars the tournament. In this insightful and bittersweet love story, masterful storyteller John Nichols brings to life northern New Mexico and three unforgettable characters.</p></p><p><strong>John Nichols</strong> is the author of twenty books of fiction and nonfiction, including <em>The Milagro Beanfield War</em> and <em>The Sterile Cuckoo</em>.

Written at the height of the Great Depression, she called on women particularly to do their part--cutting costs where needed, spending reasonably, and taking personal responsibility for keeping the economy going.<br>Whether it's the recommendation that working women take time for themselves in order to fully enjoy time spent with their families, recipes for cheap but wholesome home-cooked meals, or America's obligation to women as they take a leading role in the new social order, many of the opinions expressed here are as fresh as if they were written today.</p><p><b>Eleanor Roosevelt</b> (1884-1962) was an American politician, diplomat, and activist. She was the longest-serving First Lady of the United States, holding the post from March 1933 to April 1945.

The book integrates the historical evolution of tactics, analysis, and fleet operations, and today it can serve as a primer for anyone who wants to learn how navies fight and win. This second edition includes much new material on combat in the missile age and reflects the reconfiguration of many tactics for littoral operations after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p><br><p>Hughes recreates famous battles to show how tactics have changed through the ages and the ways in which they have remained unchanged. He covers tactical interaction between land and sea, the sensory revolution of WWII, secret weapons and maritime surprise, the role in battle of leadership and morale, and the importance of surface warships in today's U.S. fleet. He suggests that naval tactics, unlike ground combat, are dominated by the offense and concludes that the great tactical maxim must be attack effectively first.</p><br><p>A new chapter traces the evolution of missile tactics at sea and includes details of attacks on ships. Many changes emphasize joint operations and coastal combat. The already extensive appraisal of command and control and information warfare is further expanded to cover modern naval operations and the character of modern salvo warfare. In the tradition of Mahan and Clauswitz, this classic text incorporates literature, politics, and a knowledge of human nature.

It is not only the leaves that grow. Shadows grow also. Everything grows, both what receives the light, and what is cast by it. There is more in the world, all of it proliferating like neural patterns. Almost all of it: it is also the most melancholy season, for, as Alkman says, there is nothing to eat. Resurrection is far too close to death, and the moment when the sleep begins to leave your eyes is the most fragile, the most porous, for at times in spring, even the emotional granaries are depleted.<br><br>I remember the lines from Sans Soleil: &#x201c;Newspapers have been filled recently with the story of a man from Nagoya. The woman he loved died last year and he drowned himself in work&#x2014;Japanese style&#x2014;like a madman. It seems he even made an important discovery in electronics. And then in the month of May he killed himself. They say he could not stand hearing the word &#x2018;Spring.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Lagos<br><br>One sense of sleep is the disappearance of the eyes. The head turns inward, toward darkness. Another is an entry into a state of being carried. Outside a church in Lagos, a man sleeps. The body transitions from carrying itself across the earth into being carried by it, into giving itself up to that. The body of Christ is on the now-lowered cross. A white cloth is draped around him. He is not dead, only sleeping (a sleep of two nights and one long day). Around him at the moment of descent are John the Beloved, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, Mary Magdalene. Closest to him is his mother, in white. John holds out a larger white cloth with which to receive his body. The earth carries the cross. The cross carries the body. The body on the cross carries the world: in a state of sleep, one common dream is that of superhuman strength. It is said (in the Orthodox tradition) that the True Cross is made of cedar, pine, and cypress.<br><br>It is said (by Calvin) that were all the fragments of the True Cross held in all the reliquaries of all the cathedrals of Europe to be assembled, an entire ship would be filled with the gathered wood. In sleep, one form of vision is foreclosed, and another becomes available. Outside an Anglican church in Lagos, the sleeping Christ dreams of sustenance and levitation.<br><br>Btouratij<br><br>The texture of memory and the texture of dreams are curiously similar: an intense combination of a freedom verging on randomness and a specificity that feels oneiric.<br><br>Most narratives of dreams simply don&#x2019;t work, on a technical level, while most dreams do narratively &#x201c;work&#x201d; as dreams. You don&#x2019;t have a dream and think, &#x201c;That was not a dream.&#x201d; But often when you read about a dream, or see a depiction of one, you feel like you&#x2019;re reading about or seeing something that isn&#x2019;t a dream.<br><br>Nuremberg<br><br>In the spring of 1507, Albrecht D�rer returned from his second trip to Italy. He had seen Leonardo&#x2019;s oil sketches, and been impressed by their use of drapery to suggest form, movement, wind, and light. A folded drapery is cloth thinking about itself. Under pressure from itself or the influence of external agents, a material adopts a topographical surface. A material, around the axis of itself, faces some part of itself, and confounds its inside and outside.<br><br>A drapery study of D�rer&#x2019;s from 1508 shows the influence of a sketch of Leonardo&#x2019;s from about two decades earlier. Folding: &#x201c;falten&#x201d;: to bring something together, and also to iterate that bringing together: a joining and a repetition. In the crumples, pleats, gathers, creases, falls, twists, and billows of cloth is a regular irregularity that is like the surface of water, like channels of air, like God made visible. The human is the divine enfolded in skin. (There is a curious comment about folds in John&#x2019;s account of the Resurrection: a folded cloth that remained folded even as events unfolded: &#x201c;Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus&#x2019; head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself.&#x201d;) In Nuremberg, almost within sight of D�rer&#x2019;s house, I saw, about eight minutes after they began their stellar journey, some several rays of the sun describing the folds on the curtains of my hotel room.<br><br>Auckland<br><br>Tane and his siblings conspire to push apart their mother, Papatuanuku, the earth, and father, Ranginui, the sky. In the space forced between the two is the light of the world. The light falls and flows between two eyelids.<br><br>Muottas Muragl<br><br>They used to burn women here. In these peaceful-looking cantons, women accused of consorting with the Devil were executed in the most sadistic ways imaginable, for God&#x2019;s greater glory. Now the landscape is long settled, like a reputation. The eye scans and organizes the folded mountains. All is at peace. Nevertheless, in one enciphering corner of my mind I believe still that every line in every poem is the orphaned caption of a lost photograph. By a related logic, each photograph sits in the antechamber of speech. Undissolved fragments of the past can be seen through the skin of the photograph. The tectonic plates are still busy in their rockwork, and there is a faint memory of burning ash. The difference between peace and mayhem is velocity.<br><br>Piz Corvatsch<br><br>One of the smallest things in this picture&#x2014;the reddish mound at the southwest corner of the red mesh&#x2014;is in reality one of the largest. The picture was made at three thousand feet on Piz Corvatsch in the Engadin, and that wine-dark smudge is one of the great peaks of the Bernina Alps. From this point of view, it is about the same size in terms of area as the last small parcel of summer snow on the scree. Both are far smaller than the open shadows cast on the bottom left by unseen railings. Corvatsch was Nietzsche&#x2019;s favorite mountain, and maybe a line from Ecce Homo could caption this picture: &#x201c;Philosophy means living voluntarily among ice and high mountains.&#x201d;<br><br>But maybe not. Something less strident is needed for an inventory picture like this one, in which no square centimeter is allowed to lord it over any other one, just as we learn in school that a kilo of iron miraculously always weighs the same as a kilo of feathers. Instead of philosophy, this is a picture of fact: siding, poles, mesh, sky, mountain, gravel, railing, and shadow, as well as color, angle, horizon, and loss of balance.<br><br>Capri<br><br>Later on, I thought of the catalogue of ships in the Iliad. &#x201c;I could not tell over the multitude of them nor name them, / not if I had ten tongues and ten mouths, not if I had / a voice never to be broken and a heart of bronze within me, / not unless the Muses of Olympia, daughters / of Zeus of the aegis, remembered all those who came beneath Ilion.&#x201d; But that was literary, that came later. On the day itself, on the evening of the morning in which I opened up the window of my room to see the apparition of a shining fleet on the Mediterranean, what I thought of was what Edna O&#x2019;Brien said to those of us in the audience: &#x201c;We know about these beautiful waters that have death in them.&#x201d;<br><br>McMinnville<br><br>In February 1930, a man and a woman were involved in a car accident, the man died instantly. The woman, his wife, not long after. She&#x2019;d been pregnant. Their son, raised in an orphanage, became an industrialist, founded an aviation company, and died at age eighty-four in 2014.<br><br>In March 1995, a former fighter pilot died in a car accident before his thirtieth birthday. His grieving father, who had founded an aviation company and was to die many years later at the age of eighty-four, in 2014, was said by locals to have been CIA, a charge he never confirmed or denied, saying only that it was better than being KGB.<br><br>Tripoli<br><br>The date to remember is 1654. He paints The Goldfinch that year. The color harmonies are cool, the wall is as full of subtle character as a face. His life is like a brief and beautiful bridge. He studies with Rembrandt in Amsterdam. He teaches Vermeer in Delft.<br><br>The same year, 1654: I am walking in the narrow alley between the castle of the Crusaders and the busy souk. There are children wild in the alley. There is a bird on the wall. It is him, Carel Fabritius. The bird suggests it (though this bird is a bulbul) but it is the wall that confirms it. Suddenly the gunpowder depot explodes. Fabritius is killed, and most of his paintings are lost to history. But not all is lost. The bridge has been built and it has been crossed, the bridge from shadow into light. He is not yet thirty-three years old.<br><br>Brazzaville<br><br>There is that which is carried, like a cross. There is that which drapes over, like a funeral sheath. Everywhere, I begin to see as I am carried along by my eyes, are these two energies, which, with water as the third, together begin to constitute an interpretive program: the solid (like wood, iron, or stone), the solid-fluid (clothlike), and the fluid (water). On the banks of the Congo River one afternoon, a boy plays on a railing. He wears a white shirt and black gloves. Ahead of him is the cross on which he is supported, reinterpreted as red elements of iron and painted concrete. On the boy&#x2019;s body is the infant Christ&#x2019;s towel, the condemned Christ&#x2019;s loincloth, the Sudarium of Saint Veronica, the linen shroud of burial: white cloth on a body, the solid-fluid that mediates between the cross and the river. Behind him, the river rushes. Is he a type of Christ, or is he an angel (that glove is as intense and uncanny as a pair of wings), or is he Saint Christopher, the Christ bearer at the river&#x2019;s lip? But all three are carriers, and types of one another too. Like them, the boy moves between metaphors. Suddenly, he lowers his head, his eyes disappear.<br><br>Poughkeepsie<br><br>A fluency in the dialect of geography, miniatures, and paper, an inclination for creating a gently fabular atmosphere, a commitment to what seems to be plain description, a return one way or the other to the empty dreamlike classroom, and a testing of the shimmering boundary between the map and the territory are some of the things Elizabeth Bishop, Luigi Ghirri, and Italo Calvino have in common. The empty chalkboard bears the ghostly trace of everything ever written on it. Each soul has its genetics.<br><br>Milan<br><br>It holds its violence in reserve. It is symmetrical, as are most vertebrates. It is in fact bipedal, like the animal that stands up, the animal that can mourn strangers. This suggestiveness is the key to surrealism. Suddenly coming up for air, a whale breaking the sea&#x2019;s surface, the surreal object is beyond or over (sur) a reality it might have been expected to stay below. The scissors is a mask without a face.<br><br>Berlin<br><br>He is masked by the shine. The mask spreads outward. Outside the gilt frame, on the periphery, are various things imperfectly seen: too dark, too small, cut off, blurred. I took this photograph at the moment my friend came down into the lobby. It was the night we were to see the Brahms violin concerto at the Philharmonic. From time to time, people leaned back and closed their eyes, so that Brahms would seep into their bloodstream.<br><br>Btouratij<br><br>We were a few miles from Tripoli, which is dry, so we stopped by a caf� to get our last glass of wine. The woman who owned the place was from Iraq, and the caf� was decorated with postcards and images of Iraq&#x2019;s ancient history. She brought us white wine. The sun was so bright outside that the road was almost white.<br><br>Babel, famous for its tower, became Babylon, in Iraq. On the wall in a caf� in North Lebanon, Bruegel speaks for Iraq. Bruegel: he painted many things that cannot be painted.<br><br>Z�rich<br><br>I walk around the city not knowing if I am a giant in a miniature landscape or a midget in monumental surroundings. The bright sun obliterates scale. The city is modular: office plans look like city maps, and the fa�ades of buildings resemble street plans. In this fractal city, each fragment is the city in microcosm. Glimmering things&#x2014;narcotics, stimulants&#x2014;are stacked and hover just out of reach behind grille and glass. The city is a druggy rush of machine: rectilinear, vertical, tantalizing, and masked. You zoom in and in, and still remain recognizably in the city.<br><br>Imagine the city destroyed, and out of one surviving miniature, out of the DNA, say, of a shop front, the city had to be reconstructed&#x2014;as in Jurassic Park. This is one possible city, the central city. The other is the city of peripheries, which with looser structure also contains the code of the city. Both cities are ever-present in the continuous city.<br><br>Berlin<br><br>Each brick contains within its form something crushed.<br><br>I am on the board of an arts organization. We meet in the organization&#x2019;s postwar building. The design is beautiful, the rooms large and airy, the whole structure surrounded by a park. For three days we talk about the future. We drink coffee, look at charts, and exchange ideas. I enjoy the intelligence of the curators and my fellow board members. At the end of the third day, the director draws our attention to the past.<br><br>On the map of the building we are in, a second map is superimposed: the building that had been there before, before its destruction in the war. (I remember the pain when the doctor cauterized the holes in the retina of my left eye with a laser. An intense pain, not bitter like a knife but sour like darkness.) That first building is constructed in 1872. The banker Hans H. purchases it on an unrecorded date. Charlotte H. inherits the building in 1918, when her husband dies. From 1928 onward, two upper floors are converted into a clinic, for which one Kurt P. is hired as bookkeeper.<br><br>Below each map is the ghost of another. Mapping is formalized forgetfulness.<br><br>After 1933, the Jewish owner is no longer allowed to operate the clinic. In 1937, Kurt P. purchases the clinic, for a price well below its market value. Charlotte H. has three sons, all of whom flee Germany. Charlotte H. remains, steadily becoming poorer, and in March 1943, she is deported from Berlin to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Her fate there is (un)known.<br><br>Berlin<br><br>Like speech, which leaves no mark in the air, the arrangement of our bodies leaves no mark in space. A moment later, the man by the trees has moved on. He has not noticed his echo behind him, and the man who echoes him has not noticed him or, even if he has, has certainly not noticed himself noticing him. There are thousands of such echoes and agreements every minute. Almost all go unseen, and almost none are recorded, unless photography intervenes. Berlin is a city of ever-proliferating and overlapping peripheries. But even here there is a code, though it is a code made of wounds.</p><h2>Adventures of a Cat-Whiskered Girl</h2><p><p>Big Audrey is a girl . . .<br>with cat&#x2019;s whiskers . . .<br>and sort of cat&#x2019;s eyes.<br>But, is there an other cat-whiskered, sort of cat-eyed girl?</p><p>Big Audrey waves goodbye to her friends Iggy and Neddie, Seamus, and Crazy Wig, in Los Angeles and hitches a ride with bongo-playing-while-driving Marlon Brando across the country to Poughkeepsie, New York, city of mystery. She finds she has questions needing answers&#x2014;and a bit of inter-plane-of-existence traveling to do.</p><p>Big Audrey and her telepathic friend Molly zigzag off on an incredibly strange and kooky adventure, and solve the mystery of the cat-whiskered doppelganger.</p></p><p>Daniel Pinkwater is crazy about writing, and has been trying to learn how to do it for fifty years. He has written about a hundred books, all but two or three of them good. People who own radios may know Daniel Pinkwater as a popular commentator and children&#x2019;s book reviewer on National Public Radio. At one time, he lived in Los Angeles, went to a fancy private school with the children of movie stars, and ate in The Hat numerous times. He lives with his wife, the illustrator and novelist Jill Pinkwater, and several dogs and cats in a very old farmhouse in New York&#x2019;s Hudson River Valley.Gr 4-6&#x2013;Big Audrey, the cat-whiskered girl who returned with Iggy, Neddie, and Seamus to their plane of existence at the end of The Yggyssey (Houghton Harcourt, 2009), takes center stage in this adventure. Wanting to see more of this plane, she sets off on a road trip across the country and ends up in Poughkeepsie, NY. Audrey mingles with the locals&#x2013;a quirky cast of characters that includes a wise woman who shows her a picture of a 19th-century girl who looks exactly like her, cat-whiskers and all. Audrey is the only one convinced that she and the girl are not the same person, and solving this mystery takes her and her new friend, Molly, on another inter-dimensional adventure. Pinkwater once again exercises his trademark irreverent humor complete with puns and literary allusions. Short chapters adorned with spot art keep the story moving, and the fact that Audrey and Molly are rarely&#x2013;if ever&#x2013;fazed by anything that happens allows readers to breeze through this lighthearted tale that never takes itself too seriously. It is not necessary to have read the earlier titles as Audrey is the only character who makes a repeat performance. As with the first two books, the narrative rushes to a conclusion and ends somewhat abruptly with promises of future adventures. Nevertheless, it is sure to be enjoyed by fans of Pinkwater's unique talent.<i>Amanda Raklovits, Champaign Public Library, IL</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

After nearly thirty years of marriage, a dried-up, middle-aged professor frenziedly strives for new heights of carnal pleasure with his repressed, dissatisfied wife, resorting to stimulants galore for her: brandy, a handsome young lover. During the day, they record their adventures of the previous night. When they begin to suspect each other of peeping into their respective diaries, it becomes unclear whether each spouse's confessions might not be intended for the other's eyes.<br><br>Translated from the Japanese by Howard Hibbett.</p><p>"At once sensational and serious...the translation by Howard Hibbett beautifully captures the male-female interplay of the two diaries." -- The New York Times Book Review<p>"That [The Key] is a work of art can never be in doubt.

Author Ronin Ro shows courage in detailing the frightening means used by Knight to corner the market on the most hard-core of urban music.

In Little Boat, Valentine continues her exploration of spiritual life, confronting the realities of aging and death in the serene and dreamlike voice so beloved by her many readers. Infusing even the most melancholy subjects with warmth and humanity, Little Boat explores such subjects as grief, ordinary objects, illness, and memory, carrying the reader into disparate worlds, rendering the complexity of our common experience through startling images. The poet&#39;s extraordinary juxtapositions blur the boundaries of the material world and the invisible, the given and the assumed, the present and the sometimes recently absent. Readers will find Valentine&#39;s quiet epiphanies on rich display here, as this much-heralded poet quietly merges the sorrowful and the sublime.</p><p>JEAN VALENTINE is the author of ten books of poetry, including Door in the Mountain (2004), winner of the 2004 National Book Award.<i>Starred Review.</i> Signature<i>Reviewed by</i> Matthea HarveyIn <i>Little Boat</i>, her 11th collection, 2004 National Book Award&#x2013;winner Jean Valentine continues her delicate lyric investigations. Her minimalist, elided style is like the quiet concentration of a bank robber trying to crack a safe. Doors spring open throughout this book, usually where we least expect them: I sit underneath the cottonwoods&#x2014;/Friends,/ what am I meant to be doing?/ Nothing. The door is fallen down/ inside my open body/ where all the worlds touch.In The Eleventh Brother (a poem based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale The Wild Swans), Valentine focuses on a princess who, in order to change her brothers from swans back into princes, must weave 11 coats made out of nettles, and all the while, remain mute. Valentine is, after all, a poet who seeks insight and metamorphosis, but will wait for it patiently: your sister had finished weaving your other arm,/ she dove down to give it to you// through the gray water. You couldn't/ take it. You wouldn't. That ending&#x2014;the noncomittal swing door of either/or is characteristic of Valentine's embrace of contradiction and complication. When Valentine speaks in the voice of outsider artist Ray Masterson in The Artist in Prison (Masterson started making miniature embroideries while incarcerated, using threads unraveled from other inmates' socks), not only does her care and precision match Masterson's own meticulous work, but she moves beyond ekphrastic appreciation to an unexpected discovery: I will trade// what&#x2014;whole/ days when I was free// red shadow on the inside of my skull// for socks/ for threads. Imagining one's way inside the brain naturally conjures up Dickinson, as does her use of exclamation marks (outbursts that combine exuberance and despair: &#x2014;Not see you!) and her intimate conversations with God (here, Jesus). In This Side, the speaker describes carrying an antenna around like Mercury's staff, hoping to receive an indeterminate message, then adds with wonderful emphasis, <i>And</i> I left/ a bowl of milk outside the threshold the night/ the souls of the dead return, &amp; in the morning/ licked it where he licked.In Strange Light, a section of poems whose titles all begin with Hospital, the speaker is situated in the uncertainties of both life and death, present and past, euphoria and despair: Us standing there in the past/ as we were/ in life/ you turning and turning my coat buttons. This is how she leaves us, too&#x2014;gloriously and terrifyingly unmoored. <i>(Oct.)</i><i>Matthea Harvey's third book of poems,</i> Modern Life<i>, is coming in October from Graywolf.

He shows how terrorism and the growing numbers of Muslim minorities have changed our public life. Also here are Mr. Dalrymple&#39;s trenchant observations on artists and ideologues, and on the treatment of criminals and the mentally disturbed, his area of medical interest.</p><p>Theodore Dalrymple is a British doctor and writer who has worked on four continents and has most recently practiced in a British inner-city hospital and prison. He is a contributing editor for City Journal in the United States and writes a column for the London Spectator. His earlier collections of essays, Life at the Bottom and Our Culture, What&#39;s Left of It, have been widely praised.In this essay collection, British writer Dalrymple (<i>Life at the Bottom</i>) lays out a case for the decline of Western civilization, finding its symptoms lurking in everything from multiculturalism to the delusions of honesty by political leaders. Although less of a lovable curmudgeon than plain ferocious in his ire, the author's forays into literary criticism are appealing if amateurish; a former prison doctor, the author is most cogent when on his own beat, analyzing the criminal justice and medical systems. Predictably pessimistic on the political front, the author has sharp words for his fellow Brits (They are educated by the state, the state provides for them in old age and has made saving unnecessary or, in some cases, actually uneconomic; they are treated and cured by the state... they are housed by the state.... Their choices concern only sex and shopping). He saves his worst condemnation for Muslims: ([Muslim men] satisfy their sexual needs with prostitutes and those whom they quite openly call 'white sluts' ); his pieces on terrorism and suicide bombers abound with ugly stereotyping from which this otherwise entertaining book never fully recovers. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Implicitly, however, the textual recreation is the work of Poniatowska herself, who signs the acknowledgments, thanks Katherine Silver (whose translation is excellent), and writes a new dedication for the book&#34;--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.http://www.loc.gov/hlas/A fictionalized account of Tina Modotti&#39;s life covers her relationship with photographer Edward Weston, their time in Mexico, her involvement with the Mexican Communist Party, and her eventual flight to the U.S.S.R. while under suspicion for the murder of her lover</p><p>Using quotations from actual letters, characters under their actual names, and events straight out of history, Mexican novelist Elena Poniatowska has reimagined the life of actress and Communist agent Tina Modotti.

Poniatowska brushes aside questions of morality and politics to present Tina Modotti as an impetuous romantic, a heroine regardless of the rightness of her cause. The Spanish Civil War forms the backdrop for the last and most dramatic stage of Modotti&#39;s life: she was the lover of Vittorio Vidali, who specialized in assassinating anti-Stalinist leftists. Regardless of the stature of the book as literature, it gives a portrait of one of the most fascinating characters on the world stage between the World Wars.This fictionalized account of the life of Tina Modotti is a fascinating story of the complex woman caught up in the social and political turbulence of the pre-World War II era.</p><h2>Obscene in the Extreme: The Burning and Banning of John Steinbeck&#39;s the Grapes of Wrath</h2><p>Few books have caused as big a stir as John Steinbeck's <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, when it was published in April 1939. By May, it was the nation's number one bestseller, but in Kern County, California the Joads' newfound home the book was burned publicly and banned from library shelves. <i>Obscene in the Extreme</i> tells the remarkable story behind this fit of censorship.<p>When W. B. Bill&#x201d; Camp, a giant cotton and potato grower, presided over its burning in downtown Bakersfield, he declared: We are angry, not because we were attacked but because we were attacked by a book obscene in the extreme sense of the word.&#x201d; But Gretchen Knief, the Kern County librarian, bravely fought back. If that book is banned today, what book will be banned tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Obscene in the Extreme</i> serves as a window into an extraordinary time of upheaval in America a time when, as Steinbeck put it, there seemed to be a revolution . . . going on.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Rick Wartzman</b> is director of the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University and an Irvine senior fellow at the New America Foundation. He spent two decades as a reporter and editor at <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. He is co-author, with Mark Arax, of the award-winning bestseller <i>The King of California: J.G. Boswell and the Making of a Secret American Empire</i>.During May of 1939, as the Nazis were burning books throughout Germany, the people of Bakersfield Calif., did exactly the same thing with John Steinbeck's new bestseller, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>. As Wartzman (<i>The King of California</i>) shows in this intriguing account, the banning of Steinbeck's masterpiece throughout California's Kern County was orchestrated by rich local growers: men who were busy exploiting scores of Joad families, the very men Steinbeck exposed in his novel. As a pretext, the growers cited, among other things, Steinbeck's use of foul language (bastard, bitch) and vivid scenes such as Rose of Sharon, having lost her baby, offering her milk-filled breast to a starving man. One lone librarian, Gretchen Knief, led the charge against the censors, but the book&#x2014;by then a Pulitzer Prize winner&#x2014;remained banned a year later. While all this was happening, Steinbeck was suffering the strains of his collapsing first marriage. In telling this unique tale, Wartzman artfully weaves the personal and the political in a book that readers will find engaging on more than one level. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Fluoride Deception reads like a thriller, but one supported by two hundred pages of source notes, years of investigative reporting, scores of scientist interviews, and archival research in places such as the newly opened files of the Manhattan Project and the Atomic Energy Commission. The book is nothing less than an exhumation of one of the great secret narratives of the industrial era: how a grim workplace poison and the most damaging environmental pollutant of the cold war was added to our drinking water and toothpaste.</p><p>"Christopher Bryson is an excellent narrator, and he reports on recent research previously not known to me. Especially I am intrigued by the story about Phyllis Mullenix and her animal research on the influence of fluoride on behavior and brain development. . . . It is my sincere hope that his book will receive the attention it deserves and that its implications will be seriously considered." Dr. Arvid Carlsson, 2000 Nobel Prize Laureate for Medicine <p>"In much the same way biologist Rachel Carson warned us over forty years ago in Silent Spring about the havoc and harm being caused by the misuse of persistent pesticides, journalist Christopher Bryson here lays bare the secret story and hidden dangers of the introduction of fluoride chemicals from the cold war era into our drinking water. The irrefutable evidence of duplicity and cover-up presented in this book is hair-raising. The Fluoride Deception presents a scorching indictment of how researchers and health care officials working closely with government agencies, big industry, and their attorneys have allowed themselves to surrender their responsibility for the medical well-being of their fellow citizens." Dr. Albert W. Burgstahler, former president of the International Society for Fluoride Research and Emeritus Professor of Organic Chemistry, University of Kansas </p><p>"Bryson is right on in his emphasis on the ineffectiveness of fluoridation of water with industrial wastes, and its risks of nerve and brain damage, and cancer, coupled with the long-standing industrial conspiracy to suppress this information." Dr. Samuel S. Epstein, chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition and Professor Emeritus of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, University of Illinois School of Public Health </p><p>"The Fluoride Deception compellingly and inescapably exposes the murderous fraud that heads of state and industry have for decades perpetrated on an innocent public.

Really, she is. It&#x2019;s not her fault if she can&#x2019;t suppress her doubts about the relationship; Ren� is moving way too fast, and Aim�e&#x2019;s instincts tell her Meizi, this supposed love of Ren�&#x2019;s life, isn&#x2019;t trustworthy. And her misgivings may not be far off the mark: Meizi disappears during a Chinatown dinner to take a phone call and never comes back to the restaurant. Minutes later, the body of a young man, a science prodigy and volunteer at the nearby Mus�e, is found shrink-wrapped in an alleyway&#x2014;with Meizi&#x2019;s photo in his wallet.<br><br>Aim�e does not like this scenario one bit, but she can&#x2019;t figure out how the murder is connected to Meizi&#x2019;s disappearance. The dead genius was sitting on a discovery that has France&#x2019;s secret service keeping tabs on him. Now they&#x2019;re keeping tabs on Aim�e. A missing young woman, an illegal immigrant raid in progress, botched affairs of the heart, dirty policemen, the French secret service, cutting-edge science secrets and a murderer on the loose&#x2014;what has she gotten herself into?

You mean it&#x2019;s not for me?&#x201d; she joked. She<br>shook the box and heard a rattle. Maybe those jade earrings<br>she&#x2019;d seen him looking at. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re serious about Meizi?

Could be a little ticking bomb, all right.<br><br>&#x201c;Save my life, eh?&#x201d; Ren� said. &#x201c;Bring it to the<i> resto</i>, Chez<br>Chun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m in the middle of a security proposal, Ren�,&#x201d; she<br>answered, hoping he didn&#x2019;t hear the little lie in her voice. She<br>surveyed their bank of computers, which were running security<br>checks, updating client systems she&#x2019;d programmed before she<br>left.

M�tro&#x2019;s faster, Ren�.&#x201d;<br><br>She grabbed her leopard-print coat and locked the office door.<br><br>Twenty minutes later she ran up the M�tro steps, perspiring<br>and dodging commuters. Frustrated, she found herself at the<br>exit farthest from where she wanted to be, by the Romanesque<br>church that was now the Mus�e des Arts et M�tiers. Harmonic<br>Gregorian chanting wafted in the cold air and drifted into the<br>enveloping night. Petals of snow lodged like nests of white<br>feathers in the bare-branched trees. What a night, the temperature<br>falling, a storm threatening in the clouded sky. The<br>frigid air sliced her lungs, shot up the mini under her coat.<br><br>Great. She hadn&#x2019;t thought her wardrobe through, as usual.<br>Ren� had better appreciate this. Listen to sense and slow<br>things down.<br><br>She ran across the boulevard into the medieval quartier,<br>still an ungentrified slice of crumbling<i> h�tel particuliers</i>, narrow<br>cobbled streets lined by Chinese wholesale luggage and jewelry<br>shops. Red paper lanterns hanging from storefronts shuddered<br>in the wind. From a half-open door she heard the pebble-like<br>shuffling of mah-jongg tiles. This multi-block warren comprised<br>the oldest and smallest of the four Chinatowns in Paris.<br>Few knew it existed.<br><br>She reached Chez Chun, the oldest or second-oldest building<br>in Paris, depending on whom you talked to, sagging and timbered<br>beside a darkened hair salon.<br><br>Inside Chez Chun a blast of garlic, chilis, and cloying Chinese<br>pop music greeted her. The <i>resto</i>, an L-shaped affair, held<br>ten or so filled tables. Roast ducks dangled behind the takeout<br>counter. Not exactly an intimate dining spot.<br><br>Ren� cornered her at the door. &#x201c;Took you long enough,<br>Aim�e.&#x201d; Ren�, a dwarf, was always a natty dresser.

A warm smile that reached her eyes. &#x201c;Ren� said you&#x2019;d be<br>joining us. We ordered, I hope you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d; Petite, not<br>much taller than Ren�, she wore jeans and a green sweater as<br>she stood ladling abalone soup into small bowls. &#x201c;Love your<br>coat, Aim�e. Meet my parents.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Bonsoir</i>,&#x201d; Aim�e said politely.<br><br>The unsmiling Monsieur and Madame Wu stared at her.<br>&#x201c;My parents speak Wenzhou dialect,&#x201d; said Meizi with an<br>apologetic shrug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll translate.&#x201d;<br><br>Aim�e grinned, determined to thaw the atmosphere. Her<br>black-stockinged thigh caught on the plastic-covered seat.<br>Under the disapproving stare of Madame Wu, she remembered<br>Ren�&#x2019;s complaints about how Meizi&#x2019;s parents insisted on chaperoning<br>their dates.<br><br>Ren� set the present on the table beside the steaming soup.<br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, Meizi.&#x201d;<br><br>Aim�e tried not to cringe. Even if it was only earrings, it<br>was too soon. Ren� was nuts, or crazy in love.<br><br>Madame Wu turned and spoke to her husband. Aim�e heard<br>her sharp intonation, and could imagine what was being said.<br><br>But Meizi&#x2019;s face lit up in happiness as she untied the bow<br>and opened the jewelry box. To Aim�e&#x2019;s surprise, it was a ring.<br>A pearl ring, luminous and simple. &#x201c;How thoughtful, Ren�,&#x201d;<br>Meizi gasped. &#x201c;I lost my other ring at the dojo.&#x201d;<br><br>He winked. &#x201c;I hope the next one will sparkle more.&#x201d;<br><br>Meizi blushed.<br><br>Madame Wu pulled the reading glasses down from her<br>short, very black hair&#x2014;dyed, Aim�e could see&#x2014;and shook her<br>head. Round-faced Monsieur Wu, who was much older, averted<br>his gaze.<br><br>Were they criticizing Ren�&#x2019;s gift or objecting to the relationship?<br>Perhaps they didn&#x2019;t want their daughter involved<br>with a dwarf? Despite her own reservations, Aim�e felt a pang<br>for Ren�.<br><br>&#x201c;Lovely, <i>non</i>?&#x201d; Aim�e said, trying to ease the almost palpable<br>tension.<br><br>&#x201c;Try it on, Meizi,&#x201d; Ren� urged.<br><br>Aim�e noticed the look Ren� and Meizi shared. Lost in<br>each other. She nudged Ren�. He ignored her.<br><br>Madame Wu spoke sharply, and Meizi translated. &#x201c;My parents<br>say you&#x2019;re too kind, Ren�.&#x201d;<br><br>Aim�e doubted that. Meizi slipped the ring on her fourth<br>finger. &#x201c;<i>Parfait</i>.&#x201d; Aim�e noticed the bitten nails, the worn<br>calluses on Meizi&#x2019;s fingertips. Meizi set the ring back in the<br>box and passed out the steaming soup bowls. A large serving<br>for Ren�.<br><br>Meizi&#x2019;s phone vibrated on the table. She glanced at the<br>number and pushed her chair back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>Ren�&#x2019;s hand paused on his soupspoon. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you talk later,<br>Meizi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t take a moment,&#x201d; she said. As Meizi went to the<br>door, Aim�e noticed her backward glance, her beetled brow,<br>before she stepped outside.<br><br>The Wus, not ones for conversation, tucked into the soup.<br>Poor Ren�. Aim�e imagined the dinners he&#x2019;d shared with the<br>humorless Madame and Monsieur Wu. Had she read Meizi, a<br>dutiful daughter, all wrong? A young waitress cleared their<br>bowls, leaving Meizi&#x2019;s, and brought a platter of fragrant roasted<br>duck with shaved scallions. At least five more minutes passed.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Meizi?&#x201d; Ren� asked, holding off from serving himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Meizi, <i>oui</i>.&#x201d; Madame Wu nodded, her chopsticks working<br>at morsels of duck.<br><br>Aim�e wished Meizi hadn&#x2019;t left them in this awkward situation.<br>She shot Ren� a look. He flipped his phone open, hit<br>Meizi&#x2019;s number on his speed dial.<br><br>A stooped older woman wearing a stained apron entered<br>the <i>resto</i>.

He holds degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics, and a doctorate in media.

He's done the time. He's paid his dues. His wife and sister-in-law dread his release and ask for police protection. Detective Nick Miller, judo and karate expert, follows Garvold to learn where the stolen money is hidden. This 1960s police procedural never takes off. Even though characterizations are well done--British and Cockney accents are adeptly used to differentiate a variety of characters--the story remains flat.

Called The Scientist Pope, Gerbert of Aurillac rose from peasant beginnings to lead the church. By turns a teacher, traitor, kingmaker, and visionary, Gerbert is the first Christian known to teach math using the nine Arabic numerals and zero.In The Abacus and the Cross, Nancy Marie Brown skillfully explores the new learning Gerbert brought to Europe. A fascinating narrative of one remarkable math teacher, The Abacus and the Cross will captivate readers of history, science, and religion alike.</p><p><b>Nancy Marie Brown</b> is the author of <i>The Far Traveler: Voyages of a Viking Woman</i> and <i>Mendel in the Kitchen</i>, named one of the Best Sci-Tech Books of 2004 by <i>Library Journal</i>. She lives in Vermont.The pontiff in question is Sylvester II, pope from 999 to 1003. From the fragmentary evidence about Gerbert of Aurillac, Sylvester&#x2019;s name before his elevation, Brown resourcefully recounts his remarkable career and boldly asserts that the history of mathematics must be revised in light of Gerbert&#x2019;s life. Born to a humble station around 950, Gerbert&#x2019;s precocity impressed bishops and counts, and his friendship-forming personality, visible in surviving letters, showed up in places from Barcelona to Reims to Rome. Brown speculates that he also may have studied in Cordoba, then a center of Islamic erudition, where he may have learned about Arabic numerals, the abacus, and the astrolabe. In any event, she recounts that Gerbert served as a conduit of Arab science into Christian Europe as schoolmaster at Reims. His medieval scholarly renown subsequently attracted the attention of emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. As readably knowledgeable about Gerbert&#x2019;s political fortunes as about his intellectual influence, Brown is a lively narrator and interesting interpreter of Gerbert&#x2019;s life and world. This portrait gives both the science and the history audiences something to talk about. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Sarum: The Novel of England</h2><p>A masterpiece that is breathtaking in its scope, SARUM is an epic novel that traces the entire turbulent course of English history.

I was bored out of my mind. Reading was my therapy. Sarum was one of those books that I don't think I would have read unless confined to stay put. I am so glad that the timing was such that I got a chance to experience Rutherford's storytelling. The beginning of the book which is set in primitive England really hooked me and took me into the history of England gently by using the characters and families from generation to generation. While I am not a fan of English history, I am a lover of family sagas.

That's the kernel of this first SF novel from fantasy writer Kress, who recently won a Nebula Award for one of her SF stories. The Ged are an old, advanced, rational race shocked by the human violence and unpredictability that is erupting in their peaceful galaxy. To better understand their adversary, they choose the isolated, technologically regressed human colony on Qom, where they offer scientific knowledge to two warring nationsbut only if their representatives get along. This becomes the story, then, of the few people whose minds are opened despite the social, political and cultural barriers they inherited. Although the characters and their actions tend to the melodramatic, the background is well drawn and the conceptual breakthroughs are nicely handled. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.The warring cultures of Jela and Delysia become subjects of a complex experiment by an alien race who must understand the human race before they can defeat it. As Jelites and Delysians play out their violent natures under constant scrutiny by the inhuman Ged, a Delysian glassblower and a Jelite sister-warrior discover a truth that will force their peoples to work together or die. This heady mix of fantasy and sf explores humanity's infinite capacity for change. Highly recommended.

This book stands as a compelling testament to a woman&#39;s most essential freedom--control over her own body--and to the power of women helping women.</p><p>Spot and Dick play no role in Kaplan's vivid, thoughtful "collective memoir" of the Chicago women who formed Jane (officially, the Abortion Counseling Service of Women's Liberation), which gave 11,000 women access to safe but illegal abortions between 1969 and the Supreme Court's <i>Roe </i>v. <i>Wade</i> decision in January 1973. Herself a member of Jane, Kaplan describes stages in the service's brief life--from screening abortionists to referring clients to a particular practitioner to learning how to perform abortions themselves--and the issues of knowledge, power, responsibility, and respect, which had a key impact on interactions among participants as well as on Jane's relationships with clients, the medical establishment, and the criminal justice system. Because Jane kept limited records, Kaplan's reconstruction is based on interviews with some 40 percent of the 100 women who participated at one time or another; some Jane members are not prepared to be publicly identified, so Kaplan uses pseudonyms for all of them, including herself. This is lively, nuanced history that brings to life the hopes, terrors, and disappointments of a movement committed to giving women control over their own bodies. <i>Mary Carroll</i>From 1969 until the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling in 1973, a group of Chicago women formed a loose underground organization whose sole purpose was to aid women who needed abortions (then illegal, of course) in getting them as safely and inexpensively as possible. They called their referral service "Jane" and worked out a set of complicated procedures to keep both themselves and their clients out of jail. At first they handled referrals to willing doctors on a very limited basis-only three or four a week-but as word about Jane got around their business increased. Eventually the women were taught by an expert to do the abortions themselves, which enabled them to charge next to nothing to those in financial need. But the operations were not all they did; every one of the 11,000 women who came to Jane also received health education and counseling. As a study of this remarkable but little known phenomenon, this book will be of value to anyone interested in women's health, the women's movement, and women's reproductive health and rights, particularly now that those rights are coming under increasing attack.<br><i>Audrey Eaglen, Cuyahoga Cty. P.L., Parma, Ohio</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Our Time: Stories</h2><p><b>THIS COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES AND VIGNETTES MARKED ERNEST HEMINGWAY'S AMERICAN DEBUT AND MADE HIM FAMOUS</b> <p> When <i>In Our Time</i> was published in 1925, it was praised by Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald for its simple and precise use of language to convey a wide range of complex emotions, and it earned Hemingway a place beside Sherwood Anderson and Gertrude Stein among the most promising American writers of that period. <i>In Our Time</i> contains several early Hemingway classics, including the famous Nick Adams stories "Indian Camp," "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife," "The Three Day Blow," and "The Battler," and introduces readers to the hallmarks of the Hemingway style: a lean, tough prose -- enlivened by an car for the colloquial and an eye for the realistic that suggests, through the simplest of statements, a sense of moral value and a clarity of heart. </p><p> Now recognized as one of the most original short story collections in twentieth-century literature, <i>In Our Time</i> provides a key to Hemingway's later works.</p></p><p>No writer has been more efficiently overshadowed by his imitators than Ernest Hemingway. From the moment he unleashed his stripped-down, declarative sentences on the world, he began breeding entire generations of miniature Hemingways, who latched on to his subtractive style without ever wondering what he'd removed, or why. And his tendency to lapse into self-parody during the latter half of his career didn't help matters. But <i>In Our Time</i>, which Hemingway published in 1925, reminds us of just how fresh and accomplished his writing could be--and gives at least an inkling of why Ezra Pound could call him the finest prose stylist in the world.<p> In his first commercially published book (following the small-press appearance of <i>Three Stories and Ten Poems</i> in 1924), Hemingway was still wearing his influences on his sleeve. The vignettes between each story smack of Gertrude Stein, whose minimalist punctuation and clodhopping rhythms he was happy to borrow. "My Old Man" sounds like Huck Finn on the Grand Tour: "Well, we went to live at Maisons-Lafitte, where just about everybody lives except the gang at Chantilly, with a Mrs. Meyers that runs a boarding house. Maisons is about the swellest place to live I've ever seen in all my life." But in the "The Battler" or "Indian Camp" or "Big Two-Hearted River," Hemingway finds his own voice, shunning the least hint of rhetorical inflation and sticking to just the facts, ma'am. His reluctance to traffic in high-flown abstraction has often been chalked up to postwar disillusion--as though he were too much of a simpleton to make deliberate stylistic decisions. Still, nobody can read "Soldier's Home" without drawing a certain connection between the two. Returning home to Oklahoma, the hero finds that his tales of combat are now a bankrupt genre: </p><blockquote> Even his lies were not sensational at the pool room. His acquaintances, who had heard detailed accounts of German women found chained to machine guns in the Argonne forest and who could not comprehend, or were barred by their patriotism from interest in, any German machine gunners who were not chained, were not thrilled by his stories. </blockquote> If we are to believe Michael Reynolds and Ann Douglas, this passage reflects the author's own dreary homecoming as a member of the lost generation. It's also a fine example of a surprisingly rare phenomenon, at least at this point in his career: Hemingway being funny. <i>--James Marcus</i><b>Ernest Hemingway</b> ranks as the most famous of twentieth-century American writers; like Mark Twain, Hemingway is one of those rare authors most people know about, whether they have read him or not. The difference is that Twain, with his white suit, ubiquitous cigar, and easy wit, survives in the public imagination as a basically, lovable figure, while the deeply imprinted image of Hemingway as rugged and macho has been much less universally admired, for all his fame. Hemingway has been regarded less as a writer dedicated to his craft than as a man of action who happened to be afflicted with genius. When he won the Nobel Prize in 1954, <i>Time</i> magazine reported the news under Heroes rather than Books and went on to describe the author as "a globe-trotting expert on bullfights, booze, women, wars, big game hunting, deep sea fishing, and courage." Hemingway did in fact address all those subjects in his books, and he acquired his expertise through well-reported acts of participation as well as of observation; by going to all the wars of his time, hunting and fishing for great beasts, marrying four times, occasionally getting into fistfights, drinking too much, and becoming, in the end, a worldwide celebrity recognizable for his signature beard and challenging physical pursuits.</p><h2>Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book</h2><p>Walker Percy's mordantly funny and wholly original contribution to the self-help book craze deals with the Western mind's tendency toward heavy abstraction.

Even the names ring with the unmistakable sound of the quaint English countryside: Smuggler's Haunt, Mustard Pot Hall, Wealden Close, Rose Cottage. Most are relatively traditional, though no less appealing, with lots of plump chintz cushions, botanical prints, nautical themes, pleasantly weathered furnishings, and hutches overflowing with crockery. But a few are refreshingly different, such as the vibrantly hued Cider-House Cottage, where the owner painted fanciful designs all over each room to warm the cold look of the stone walls, or Folly Cottage, with its bright red walls and many Gothic accents.

It's a hot spot, a convergence point for unusually strong currents of energy, which might explain why the town attracts misfits and drifters like moths to a flame. Now someone else has been drawn to the Cove-Isabella Valdez, on the run from some very dangerous men.<br><br> When she starts work as Fallon's assistant, Isabella impresses him by organizing his pathologically chaotic office-and doesn't bat an eye at the psychic aspect of his job. She's a kindred spirit, a sanctuary from a world that considers his talents a form of madness. But after a routine case unearths an antique clock infused with dark energy, Fallon and Isabella are dragged into the secret history of Scargill Cove and forced to fight for their lives, as they unravel a cutthroat conspiracy with roots in the Jones family business . . . and Isabella's family tree.</p><p>Jayne Ann Krentz is the author of fifty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

Not content with just efficiently organizing Fallon&#x2019;s office, Isabella insists on learning the detective business, too, and she quickly has her own first case, investigating a &#x201c;haunted&#x201d; house. Once Isabella senses the house is troubled by more than a ghost, she calls Fallon for backup, and that&#x2019;s when Fallon realizes his new assistant has not only a few unique talents of her own but also a mysterious past that could come back to haunt them both. In Too Deep, the first in the Looking Glass Trilogy as well as part of Krentz&#x2019;s ongoing Arcane Society series, is the perfect mixture of paranormal-flavored suspense and sexy romance. Krentz&#x2019;s flair for creating intriguing, inventive plots; crafting clever dialogue between two perfectly matched protagonists; and subtly infusing her writing with a deliciously tart sense of humor are, as always, simply irresistible. --John Charles</p><h2>Pathfinder Player Companion: Divine Anthology</h2><p>To know the Word of your God, you should read the Book of your God!

After sharing the experience of growing his own food in <i>Second Nature</i>, he illuminated how our appetites drive the evolution of edible plants with <i>The Botany of Desire</i>. Then he pondered <i>The Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma</i>, weighing our precarious food chain and popularizing the pleasures of eating local; <i>In Defense of Food</i> and <i>Food Rules</i> distilled his conclusions into a manifesto and a manual. With <i>Cooked</i>, he closes the seed-to-table loop with a passionate exploration of the satisfying transformation of grilling, braising, baking, and fermenting--and their primal roots. Learning to cook elevated humans from lone animals into increasingly intelligent, civilized groups, and though we spend scant time doing real cooking, we&#x2019;ve become obsessed with watching people cook--a paradox that points to longing for a lost experience. Through his own experiences making and enjoying food with pit masters, chefs, bakers, and &#x201c;fermentos,&#x201d; he retraces our path to connection with real ingredients and health for people and planet. Whether you&#x2019;re sympathetic or skeptical, you can&#x2019;t help but appreciate Pollan&#x2019;s genius for conveying the elemental appeal of making a meal. <i>--Mari Malcolm</i><b>Michael Pollan</b>, recently featured on Netflix in the four-part series <i>Cooked</i>,&nbsp;is the author of seven previous books, including <i>Food Rules, In Defense of Food, The Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma</i>, and <i>The Botany of Desire</i>, all <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

Reprint.</p><p>May 23, 1939. Television was being advertised for the first time to American consumers. Europe was on the brink of war as Hitler and Mussolini signed an alliance in Berlin. These were the days before sonar and before the discovery of nuclear power revolutionized submarine design. Dependent on battery power, submarines were actually surface ships that "occasionally dipped beneath the waves." If a sub went down, "every man on board was doomed. It was accepted that there would be no deliverance." <p>Swede Momsen was, according to master storyteller Peter Maas, the "greatest submariner the Navy ever had," and he was determined to beat those odds. Momsen spent his career trying to save the lives of trapped submariners, despite an indifferent Navy bureaucracy that thwarted and belittled his efforts at every turn. Every way of saving a sailor entombed in a sub--"smoke bombs, telephone marker buoys, new deep-sea diving techniques, escape hatches, artificial lungs, a great pear-shaped rescue chamber--was either a direct result of Momsen's inventive derring-do, or of value only because of it." Yet on the day the Squalus sank, none of Momsen's inventions had been used in an actual submarine disaster. </p><p> In <i>The Terrible Hours</i>, Maas reconstructs the harrowing 39 hours between the disappearance of the submarine Squalus during a test dive off the New England coast and the eventual rescue of 33 crew members trapped in the vessel 250 feet beneath the sea. It's also the story of Momsen's triumph. Under the worst possible circumstances, Momsen led a successful mission and helped change the future of undersea lifesaving. Not only has Maas written a carefully researched and suspenseful tribute to a true hero, in the process he has salvaged a long-forgotten, riveting piece of American history. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>7 cds</p><h2>Little House on Rocky Ridge (Rose Years)</h2><p>Picks up the Wilder family history as Laura, Almanzo, and daughter Rose travel in a covered wagon to Missouri where they purchase Rocky Ridge Farm and make a new life for themselves</p><p>Rose and her parents Laura and Almanzo are moving to the land of the Big Red Apple!

What if you could lose weight, look younger, and improve your sex life in only four weeks? The solution to your problems doesn&#x2019;t call for lengthy treatments at health spas or expensive surgeries, and it won&#x2019;t require you to give up all of your favorite foods. All you need to do is get a good night&#x2019;s sleep.&nbsp;<br><br> Research shows that sleep deprivation affects every aspect of our lives. With a good night&#x2019;s sleep your skin will glow, you will no longer crave unhealthy foods, and you&#x2019;ll increase your sex drive. Dr. Michael Breus has outlined a program that will not only help you to get a better night&#x2019;s sleep tonight but will give you the tools to become more beautiful than you&#x2019;ve ever been.</p><p>MICHAEL BREUS is a practicing Ph.D. in clinical psychology with a specialty in clinical sleep disorders. He oversees sleep labs across Southern California and Arizona, and consults with major airlines and hotel chains to provide effective sleep tips for their customers. He is a regular contributor to WebMD Community, WebMD Video, and WebMD the Magazine, and has been a featured guest on the Today Show, The View, the CBS Early Show, and the Jane Pauley Show.Clinical psychologist Breus, WebMD.com's sleep expert, has reassuring news: the heavy sleep debt that most of us have racked up through years of high-stress, stimulant-filled living can be recouped. According to Breus, by calculating the amount of sleep needed and eliminating habits that conflict with a healthy sleep regiment and disrupt natural circadian rhythms, most people can achieve full, deep and restful sleep without pharmaceuticals; resist major diseases; lose weight; think more clearly; look younger; and improve their relationships and sex life. Even those who travel frequently or work on revolving shifts, Breus says, can implement simple strategies to get quality sleep. He offers a 28-night program in which readers go through "sleep boot camp," including a sleep diary, bedroom makeover, diet overhaul, exercise and relaxation techniques. By taking quizzes and examining lifestyles, readers will pinpoint obvious (anxiety, caffeine) and not-so-obvious (medications, hormones, confused body clocks) causes for insomnia and exhaustion. He discusses the pros and cons of taking medication, as well as the dangers of taking melatonin. Breus's enthusiasm for his subject is as attractive as his promises-and may make readers eager to do some hard work tackling stubborn habits that stand in the way of a good night's sleep.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here, in seven chapters, he delivers messages that inspire us first to recognize our servitude-to money, possessions, corporations, the status quo, and our own fears-and then shows us how to begin the self-defining process toward liberation. <br><br><i>Seven Simple Steps to Personal Freedom</i> is a powerfully affirming, large-hearted, and life-changing book that asks us all to take the greatest risk for the greatest reward-our own freedom.<br><br></p><p><br>Gerry Spence is the author of twelve books. A lawyer by training, he has been involved in many high-profile cases, including the radiation poisoning death of Karen Silkwood, and has appeared on Oprah, 60 Minutes, and Larry King Live, and is currently a regular guest on Rivera Live. He lives with his wife in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.<br><br>The advice in this short book which expands on Give Me Liberty from noted attorney Spence (How to Argue and Win Every Time) sometimes sounds more simplistic than simple. "Slavery in any form begins and ends with the self," he declares portentously, arguing that no external circumstance can free us. (His regular use of the term "slavery" seems a rather cavalier dismissal of actual slavery.) He calls an official picture identification "the precursor of tattoos on our wrists," attempting to show how people are complicit in their slavery. People must question ideas, particularly religion, he advises. After all, the church has long served power, from the Civil War to industrialization through its "endemic attraction to power" today. (What about Martin Luther King Jr.?) "Work that enables us to experience the deep pleasure of creativity is virtue," Spence says, urging readers to cultivate a sense of play. "I have never known a man who grew unless he was alone," he declares, but surely interaction can foster growth as well? "The exchange of work for security is a false bargain," he adds, damning unions along with employers. His solution: a "union of one." Spence wisely urges us to avoid greed and reminds us to not compare ourselves (our intelligence, money, beauty) with others, but to recognize inner worth. Further, he advocates a plainer life with less money but more time for family, and simpler virtues. Spence's florid rhetorical flights work better as a set of disparate exhortations than as a comprehensive handbook. <p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Stuff of Legend Book 4: The Toy Collector</h2><p><ul> <li>Continuing the saga of the <i>New York Times </i>Bestselling Graphic Novel!

He is the author of the novels <i>The Cellist of Sarajevo</i>, which was an IndieBound and a Barnes and Noble Discover selection and has been chosen for community reads across the country, and <em>The Confabulist</em>.The Cellist<br>It screamed downward, splitting air and sky without effort. A target expanded in size, brought into focus by time and velocity. There was a moment before impact that was the last instant of things as they were. Then the visible world exploded.<br><br>In 1945, an Italian musicologist found four bars of a sonata&#x2019;s bass line in the remnants of the firebombed Dresden Music Library. He believed these notes were the work of the seventeenth-century Venetian composer Tomaso Albinoni, and spent the next twelve years reconstructing a larger piece from the charred manuscript fragment. The resulting composition, known as Albinoni&#x2019;s Adagio, bears little resemblance to most of Albinoni&#x2019;s work and is considered fraudulent by most scholars. But even those who doubt its authenticity have difficulty denying the Adagio&#x2019;s beauty.<br><br>Nearly half a century later, it&#x2019;s this contradiction that appeals to the cellist. That something could be almost erased from existence in the landscape of a ruined city, and then rebuilt until it is new and worthwhile, gives him hope. A hope that, now, is one of a limited number of things remaining for the besieged citizens of Sarajevo and that, for many, dwindles each day.<br><br>And so today, like every other day in recent memory, the cellist sits beside the window of his second-floor apartment and plays until he feels his hope return. He rarely plays the Adagio. Most days he&#x2019;s able to feel the music rejuvenate him as simply as if he were filling a car with gasoline. But some days this isn&#x2019;t the case. If, after several hours, this hope doesn&#x2019;t return, he will pause to gather himself, and then he and his cello will coax Albinoni&#x2019;s Adagio out of the firebombed husk of Dresden and into the mortar-pocked, sniper-infested streets of Sarajevo. By the time the last few notes fade, his hope will be restored, but each time he&#x2019;s forced to resort to the Adagio it becomes harder, and he knows its effect is finite. There are only a certain number of Adagios left in him, and he will not recklessly spend this precious currency.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t always like this. Not long ago the promise of a happy life seemed almost inviolable. Five years ago at his sister&#x2019;s wedding, he&#x2019;d posed for a family photograph, his father&#x2019;s arm slung behind his neck, fingers grasping his shoulder. It was a firm grip, and to some it would have been painful, but to the cellist it was the opposite. The fingers on his flesh told him that he was loved, that he had always been loved, and that the world was a place where above all else the things that were good would find a way to burrow into you. Though he knew all of this then, he would give up nearly anything to be able to go back in time and slow down that moment, if only so he could more clearly recall it now. He would very much like to feel his father&#x2019;s hand on his shoulder again.<br><br>He can tell today won&#x2019;t be an Adagio day. It has been only a half-hour since he sat down beside the window, but already he feels a little bit better. Outside, a line of people wait to buy bread. It&#x2019;s been over a week since the market&#x2019;s had any bread to buy, and he considers whether he might join them. Many of his friends and neighbours are in line. He decides against it, for now. There&#x2019;s still work to do.<br>It screamed downward, splitting air and sky without effort. A target expanded in size, brought into focus by time and velocity. There was a moment before impact that was the last instant of things as they were. Then the visible world exploded.<br><br>When the mortars destroyed the Sarajevo Opera Hall, the cellist felt as if he were inside the building, as if the bricks and glass that once bound the structure together became projectiles that sliced and pounded into him, shredding him beyond recognition. He was the principal cellist of the Sarajevo Symphony Orchestra. That was what he knew how to be. He made the idea of music an actuality. When he stepped on stage in his tuxedo he was transformed into an instrument of deliverance. He gave to the people who came to listen what he loved most in the world. He was as solid as the vice of his father&#x2019;s hand.<br><br>Now he doesn&#x2019;t care whether anyone hears him play or not. His tuxedo hangs in the closet, untouched. The guns perched on the hills surrounding Sarajevo have dismantled him just as they have the opera hall, just as they have his family home in the night while his father and mother slept, just as they will, eventually, everything.<br><br>The geography of the siege is simple. Sarajevo is a long ribbon of flat land surrounded on all sides by hills. The men on the hills control all the high ground and one peninsula of level ground in the middle of the city, Grbavica. They fire bullets and mortars and tank shells and grenades into the rest of the city, which is being defended by one tank and small hand-held weapons. The city is being destroyed.<br><br>The cellist doesn&#x2019;t know what is about to happen. Initially the impact of the shell won&#x2019;t even register. For a long time he&#x2019;ll stand at his window and stare. Through the carnage and confusion he&#x2019;ll notice a woman&#x2019;s handbag, soaked in blood and sparkled with broken glass. He won&#x2019;t be able to tell whom it belongs to. Then he&#x2019;ll look down and see he has dropped his bow on the floor, and somehow it will seem to him that there&#x2019;s a great connection between these two objects. He won&#x2019;t understand what the connection is, but the feeling that it exists will compel him to undress, walk to the closet and pull the dry cleaner&#x2019;s plastic from his tuxedo.<br><br>He will stand at the window all night and all through the next day. Then, at four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, twenty-four hours after the mortar fell on his friends and neighbours while they waited to buy bread, he will bend down and pick up his bow. He will carry his cello and stool down the narrow flight of stairs to the empty street. The war will go on around him as he sits in the small crater left at the mortar&#x2019;s point of impact. He&#x2019;ll play Albinoni&#x2019;s Adagio. He&#x2019;ll do this every day for twenty-two days, a day for each person killed. Or at least he&#x2019;ll try. He won&#x2019;t be sure he will survive. He won&#x2019;t be sure he has enough Adagios left.<br><br>The cellist doesn&#x2019;t know any of this now, as he sits at his window in the sun and plays. He isn&#x2019;t yet aware. But it&#x2019;s already on its way. It screams downward, splitting air and sky without effort. A target expands in size, brought into focus by time and velocity. There is a moment before impact that is the last instant of things as they are. Then the visible world explodes.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Northern Lights (His Dark Materials)</h2><p><b><b><b><b><i>*****&nbsp;Includes an exciting preview of&nbsp;</i>THE BOOK OF DUST,<i>&nbsp;the long-awaited new book from Philip Pullman set in the world of His Dark Materials, arriving October 2017! *****</i></b></b><br></b><br><br>The modern fantasy classic that <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> named an &#x201c;All-Time Greatest Novel&#x201d; and <i>Newsweek </i>hailed as a &#x201c;Top 100 Book of All Time.&#x201d; Philip Pullman takes readers to a world where humans have animal familiars and where parallel universes are within reach.</b><br><br>Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule.

Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, <i>The Golden Compass</i>, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal <i>daemon</i>, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied: <blockquote> As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had daemons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. </blockquote> Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is "clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war." But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her daemon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey daemon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from "gyptians" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear. <p> In <i>The Golden Compass</i>, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman<br>I love this book, so when we decided to give out copies at a convention this summer, I was thrilled!

Their book <i>Auschwitz</i> won the National Jewish Book Award.During the past half-century Holocaust studies have perhaps become the most vital area of historical research. Yet books with the significance of this new history of the Holocaust are rare it is exhaustive as well as consistently insightful. From the opening chapters in which the authors, contradicting popular wisdom, argue that the direct eliminationist roots of the Holocaust are found not so much in the centuries-old European anti-Semitic legal regulations, but in the Inquisition's intention of social purification, the Terror of the French Revolution and the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by the Turks in 1915 Dwork and van Pelt challenge and provoke. Rather then viewing the Holocaust as a distinct historical phenomenon, the authors do their best to integrate it into a wide range of historical, cultural and social conditions. In discussing the German subjugation of Poland, for example, they focus on how gentile Poles saw the extermination of Jews as a precursor to their own fate; in their discussion of how Jews coped with ghetto life, the authors examine in detail the underground schooling systems that benefited both students and teachers. They also place the history of rescue efforts (usually based on personalities such as Oskar Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg) in a broader and more complicated geographic and social perspective. The book is also filled with fascinating details that challenge our preconceptions for instance, it is a myth, they note, that King Christian of Denmark wore a yellow star in sympathy with his country's Jews, since no Nazi order was ever given for Danish Jews to be so identified. Like their important earlier work Auschwitz (winner of a National Jewish Book Award), this is beautifully and lucidly written, presenting complex and important information in a highly accessible manner. 75 illus., 16 maps.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sweet Hell Inside: A Family History</h2><p><p>With the panoramic story of one "colored elite" family who rises from the ashes of the Civil War to create an American cultural dynasty Edward Ball offers the historical and, literary successor to his highly acclaimed <em>Slaves in the Family,</em> a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and winner of the 1998 National Book Award.</p><p><em>The Sweet Hell Inside</em> recounts the lives of the Harleston family of South Carolina, the progeny of a Southern gentleman and his slave who cast off their blemished roots and achieved affluence in part through a surprisingly successful funeral parlor business. Their wealth afforded the Harlestons the comfort of chauffeurs, tailored clothes, and servants whose skin was darker than theirs. It also launched the family into a generation of glory as painters, performers, and photographers in the "high yellow" society of America's colored upper class. The Harlestons' remarkable one-hundred-year journey spans the waning days of Reconstruction, the precious art world of the early 1900s, the back alleys of the Jazz Age, and the dawn of the civil rights movement.</p><p>Enhanced by the recollections of the family's archivist, eighty-four-year-old Edwina Harleston Whitlock -- whose bloodline the author shares<em>The Sweet Hell Inside</em> features a portrait artist whose subjects included industrialist Pierre Du Pont; a black classical composer in the Lost Generation of 1920s Paris; an orphanage founder who created a famous brass band from the ranks of his abandoned waifs, a number of whom went on to burgeoning careers in jazz; and a Harleston mistress who doubled as an abortionist.</p><p>With evocative and engrossing storytelling, Edward Ball introduces a cast of historical characters rarely seen before: cultured, vain, imperfect, rich, and black, a family made up of eccentrics who defied social convention yet whose advantages could not protect them from segregation's locked doors, a plague of early death, and the stigma of children born outside marriage.</p><p><em>The Sweet Hell Inside</em> raises the curtain on a unique family drama in the pageant of American life and uncovers a fascinating lost world.</p></p><p><p>Edward Ball was born in Georgia, raised in the South, and worked in New York as an art critic. His first book, <em>Slaves in the Family,</em> told the story of his search for the descendants of his ancestors' slaves. He lives in Charleston, South Carolina, with his wife, Elizabeth.</p>In researching the bestseller Slaves in the Family (1998), Ball encountered William Harleston (1804-1874), a white man whose family considered him a bachelor though he lived for 25 years with Kate Wilson, his former slave, on and around the South Carolina rice plantation where he was born. They had eight children (born between 1843 and 1867) whose family history is recounted here largely via the memories of Edwina Harleston Whitlock (b. 1916), Ball's previously unknown relation, who referenced the "little red book" and "snippets of letters, handwritten copies of wills and genealogical charts" passed on to her by an uncle. Covering nearly 200 years, Ball's book tells "a tale of black and white sex in America, and its latter-day harvest," distinguished by remarkable family accomplishments and sprinkled with diverting scandal. By 19th-century standards, William and Kate's sons were educated professionals (butler, housepainter, tailor); their daughters married well. Their son Edwin's undertaking business brought wealth and status, affording the next generation a good education and the means to pursue the arts, teaching and social work. More fame arrived when Edwin's daughter married Daniel Joseph Jenkins, "a dark minister who was born a slave," who became founder of the orphanage in Charleston that spawned the Jenkins Orphanage Band, a force in the development of jazz. Ball's somewhat uneven work often digresses into such subjects as the history of jazz, the Harlem Renaissance and even embalming. A genealogical chart would have benefited readers, and scholars will find the notes a thorny grab bag. But Ball's mosaic illuminates the Harlestons' "little-known but fascinating role in the American national saga." More than 60 photos not seen by PW.

The author landed in a heap of trouble when the Wall Street Journal reported that she had smoked marijuana in the Vanderbilt University chancellor's residence for relief from "an inner ear ailment," in addition to having caused "stirs on campus with her liberal politics." Clearly, this first lady of a university run by Old South conservatives was destined for a spectacular pratfall from grace.<br> Higher Education is a bravely told tale from a highly original perspective. It will captivate readers interested in the behind-the-scenes intrigue of American university politics and the current controversy surrounding the legalization of medical marijuana.<br> Constance Bumgarner Gee was the first lady and a faculty member at Vanderbilt University, Brown University, and Ohio State University.

For centuries artists have been pushing the limits of society&#x2019;s norms, whether in the form of a new technique, subject matter, or message. In the 15th century, a fresco by Masaccio shocked audiences by playing with perspective to depict Adam and Eve&#x2019;s expulsion from Eden. Some 500 years later, Diego Rivera featured Lenin at the center of Man at the Crossroads, commissioned by John D. Rockefeller Jr. for the lobby of New York's soon-to-be-completed Rockefeller Center; the mural was destroyed when it was deemed too radical to display. This fascinating volume presents dozens of paintings, prints, photographs, and installations that horrified audiences when they were created. Each example is presented in generous spreads with large color reproductions and an insightful text exploring the artist's intentions and the piece's historical context. Most of these works no longer have the power to shock us, but a number of them still do. Together they offer a thought-provoking exploration of the artist&#x2019;s duty to instigate, inspire, and move audiences toward new ways of thinking.</p><p>This fascinating volume presents dozens of paintings, prints, photographs, and installations that horrified audiences when they were created.

Washington could not have known it, but the brief and deadly exchange of fire that ensued lit the match that, in Horace Walpole's memorable phrase, would "set the world on fire." The resultung French and Indian War in North America became part of the global conflict known as the Seven Years War, fought across Europe, India, and the East and West Indies. Before it ended, nearly one million men had died.</p><p><i>Empires at War</i> captures the sweeping panorama of this first world war, especially in its descriptions of the strategy and intensity of the engagements in North America, many of them epic struggles between armies in the wilderness. William M. Fowler Jr. views the conflict both from British prime minister William Pitt's perspective-- as a vast chessboard, on which William Shirley's campaign in North America and the fortunes of Frederick the Great of Prussia were connected-- and from that of field commanders on the ground in America and Canada, who contended with disease, brutal weather, and scant supplies, frequently having to build the very roads they marched on. As in any conflict, individuals and events stand out: Sir William Johnson, a baronet and a major general of the British forces, who sometimes painted his face and dressed like a warrior when he fought beside his Indian allies; Edward Braddock's doomed march across Pennsylvania; the valiant French defense of Fort Ticonderoga; and the legendary battle for Quebec between armies led by the arisocratic French tactical genius, the marquis de Montcalm, and the gallant, if erratic, young Englishman James Wolfe-- both of whom died on the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759.</p><p>For many, the French and Indian War has been merely the backdrop for James Fenimore Cooper's famous novel, <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>. William M. Fowler Jr.'s engrossing narrative reveals it to have been a turning point of modern history, without which the American Revolution as we know it might well not have occurred.</p></p><p>Most histories of the Seven Years' War focus on either the European or the North American theatre of the war. William Fowler's <i>Empires at War</i> is original, and praiseworthy, because he troubles to set the North American conflict in the European context. Bravo! Written in lively and engaging prose, <i>Empires at War</i> tells the story of what Fowler calls the "first world war." By keeping one foot in the North American wilderness and the other in the courts of Europe, Fowler makes a strong claim for the critical importance of early Canadian history to the history of the world. Fowler is also to be praised for the prominent role he assigns to the First Nations of eastern North America, who fought according to their own agendas and not merely as French or British auxiliaries. A third strength of this work is to found in Fowler's willingness to shatter myths. For example, many American historians have chosen to ignore George Washington's shameful conduct at Jumonville Glen, or they have looked for excuses for it. Fowler, to his credit, lays the blame right where it belongs: "It remains an open question why Washington felt compelled to attack a sleeping camp without warning at a time when two nations were at peace." Fowler is particularly good at fleshing out all of his characters: General Jeffrey Amherst is ruthless and brutal; James Wolfe nervous and complaining; the Marquis de Montcalm pessimistic and defeatist. The Seven Years&#x2019; War led directly to the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the rise of Great Britain as a 19th-century superpower. It is vitally important that we learn more about these connections, and Fowler's <i>Empires at War</i> is a great place to start. <i>--William Newbigging</i><p>Praise for <i>Empires at War</i></p><p>"William Fowler is a superb historian, and his <i>Empires at War</i> is absolutely first rate-- both a work of expert scholarship and a clear, insightful unfolding of one of the great dramas in history, the importance of which can hardly be overstated."-- David McCullough, author of <i>John Adams</i> and <i>Truman</i></p><p>"A masterful account of the clash of two great empires. Ultimate victory by the British and their colonial allies ended in the expulsion of France from North America and brought the English vast new territories. It also brought them a mountain of debt, which they determined to reduce by levying taxes on the colonists-- laying the groundwork for the American Revolution. Mr. Fowler has told this immensely complex story with such clarity and knowledge that the reader is caught up in the danger and excitement of that critical time."-- Richard Ketchum, author of <i>Victory at Yorktown: The Campaign That Won the Revolution </i>and <i>Divided Loyalties: How the American Revolution Came to New York</i></p></p><h2>Grayson: The Superspy Omnibus</h2><p><b><i>Grayson</i>, the high-octane, highly acclaimed superspy thriller featuring ex-Nightwing Dick Grayson, is now collected in its entirety in this gorgeous hardcover compendium, featuring all of the infamous Agent 37's adventures, from his first mission to his very last.</b><br><br>Unmasked, targeted, and presumed dead, Dick Grayson's world has been turned upside down.

He served as CEO of the company from 1964 to 2004, as board chairman through 2016, and he is currently Chairman Emertius. He lives in Oregon with his wife, Penny.&#39;This memoir by the founder of Nike is a must-read for everyone on your list. Knight shares the inside story of the company&#39;s early days as a start-up and how it evolved into one of the world&#39;s most iconic brands.&#39; * Sports Illustrated * &#39;Nike founder Phil Knight&#39;s book, Shoe Dog, is the ultimate story of entrepreneurship - and the grit, passion and perseverance required to succeed.&#39; -- Ivanka Trump &#39;The best book I read last year was Shoe Dog, by Nike&#39;s Phil Knight. Phil is a very wise, intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller&#39; -- Warren Buffett &#39;Shoe Dog is a great American story about luck, grit, know-how and the magic alchemy of a handful of eccentric characters who came together to build Nike. That it happened at all is a miracle, because as I learned from this book, though we are a nation that extols free enterprise, we also excel at thwarting it. This is Phil Knight, one on one, no holds barred. The lessons he imparts about entrepreneurship and the obstacles one faces in trying to create something, are priceless. The pages I folded down are too many to mention.&#39; -- Abraham Verghese, author of &#39;Cutting for Stone&#39; &#39;A touching, highly entertaining adventure odyssey, with much to teach about innovation and creativity. Phil Knight takes us back to the Big Bang of the swoosh, recalls how he first begged and borrowed from reluctant banks, how he assembled a crew of eccentric but brilliant misfits, how they all worked together to build something unique and paradigm-changing. An inspiration for everyone with an unconventional dream.&#39; -- Michael Spence, Nobel Prize-winning economist &#39;I&#39;ve known Phil Knight since I was a kid, but I didn&#39;t really know him until I opened this beautiful, startling, intimate book. And the same goes for Nike. I&#39;ve worn the gear, with pride, but I didn&#39;t realize the remarkable saga of innovation and survival and triumph that stood behind every swoosh. Candid, funny, suspenseful, literary this is a memoir for people who love sport, but above all it&#39;s a memoir for people who love memoirs.&#39; -- Andre Agassi `A refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like. It&#39;s a messy, perilous, and chaotic journey riddled with mistakes, endless struggles, and sacrifice... In the pages of Shoe Dog, however, Knight opens up in a way few CEOs are willing to do. He&#39;s incredibly tough on himself and his failings... Knight is amazingly honest about the accidental nature of his company&#39;s success... It&#39;s an amazing tale. It&#39;s real.&#39; -- Bill Gates</p><h2>The Verse by the Side of the Road: The Story of the Burma-Shave Signs and Jingles</h2><p>"In the fall of 1925, young Allan Odell conceived the idea of using consecutive signs along the roadside. . . .

Many people who struggle with assertiveness are paralyzed by worries that they&#x2019;ll seem mean, petty, or that they will hurt the other person&#x2019;s feelings. Even though they want to speak up, they may keep their true needs and opinions to themselves because of these fears&#x2014;eventually building stress, resentment, and alienation. <b>The Guide to Compassionate Assertiveness</b> does not require that readers ignore the needs of others and focus solely on their own desires. Rather, this unique blend of cognitive behavioral therapy-based assertiveness training and Buddhist psychology helps readers practice assertiveness skills while caring deeply about the welfare of others.</p><br><p>This book helps readers develop a form of assertiveness that emphasizes collaboration, negotiation, and compromise. It focuses on speaking up for the benefit of others and speaking up for the relationship, not just one&#x2019;s own needs.

This book is the ideal assertiveness guide for those who are afraid of rejection, have a deep concern for how others perceive them, often feel judged by others, or have difficulty expressing their feelings and needs. Readers learn to apply assertiveness skills in all domains of their lives, including in romantic relationships, as parents, at work, and in social settings.</p></p><p><p><b>Sherrie M.

In an account filled with graphic descriptions of life and death in the trenches, the author demonstrates that the dreadful losses of 1st July were a direct consequence of meticulous German planning and preparation. <br><br>Although the Battle of the Somme was frequently a close-run affair, poor Allied co-ordination and persistence in attacking weakly on narrow fronts played into the hands of the German commanders, who were able to rush forward reserves, maintain the overall integrity of their defenses and so continue a successful delaying battle until the onset of winter ultimately neutralized the considerable Allied superiority in men and material.</p><p>Educated at Inverness Royal Academy, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Universities of Lancaster and Westminster, Jack Sheldon completed a thirty-five year career as a member of the Queen&#x2019;s Lancashire Regiment. In 1982 he graduated from the German General Staff course at the F�hrungsakademie, Hamburg and went on to fill international staff appointments and to command an infantry training battalion. His final post before retirement in 2003 was as Military Attach� Berlin. He now lives in France and has rapidly established himself as an expert in German First World War history. He was an honorary researcher for the Thiepval Visitor Centre Project, is a member of the British Commission for Military History and is the author of the highly acclaimed The German Army on the Somme 1914 &#x2013; 1916, The German Army at Passchendaele and a number of Battleground Europe titles."...very difficult indeed to find fault with this book. ...a magnificent addition to anybody&#x2019;s Great War library and quite simply an invaluable resource..... adds greatly to our knowledge and sources and because so much is new it is definitely not a regurgitation of established work previously available to the mainstream reader...a 5 star book and is a key resource for the understanding of the human dimension on the Western Front."

One drunken thought triggers another. Amorous conquests alternate with sundry mishaps and in the exuberant telling acquire the same weight and substance as earth-shattering events. To say nothing of the historical perspective, which the self-styled "engineer of human feet" bends at random to suit his mood.

It stands for all that is gentle, beautiful, delicate, and sweet of temperament. It is also a synonym for the Moon. A person is complimented by calling him/her saumya, moon-like. A saumya face, saumya mien is what one looks for in choosing a friend. Soma is part of the eternal pair of Agni- Soma. Agni is the fire element; Soma is the water element, moonlike. This pair is the Vedic equivalent of the Taoist yin-yang principle, balancing of the female and the male, energizer (female) and the energized (male). What is the secret of Soma, the legendary mystic drink of immortality, first lauded by India&#39;s ancient Vedic seers? Is Soma a single plant, a type of plants, a way of healing, a special intoxicant, or an inner elixir produced by Yoga and meditation? Going back to the vision of the Vedic seers, David Frawley reveals the secret of Soma for body, mind and spirit, with its profound implications from diet and herbs to pranayama, mantra and meditation. His new analysis of Soma, reflecting forty years of study of Vedic texts, is practical, comprehensive and deeply insightful so that you can bring the secret power of Soma into all aspects of your life and consciousness, and for the world as a whole.</p><p>David Frawley is a world renowned teacher of Yoga, Ayurveda, Vedic astrology and Veda and the author of several definitive texts in these fields over the past twenty-five years.<br>He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br>Vamadeva's tour of well-being, incisive and empirical, always comes back to us, to the goodness in our life. ...This book's fundamental message reminded me of Abraham Lincoln's maxim: "In the end, it's not the years in your life that count.

Four days earlier, on November 26, 1866, the British-flagged passenger vessel had departed under calm skies from Buenos Aires, destined for New York City, but conditions had soured quickly once the Lord Clarendon veered into the path of an &#x201c;unusually violent&#x201d; Argentine pampero, a polar wind blowing off the fertile plains of lower South America. Belowdecks, supine in his bunk, thirty-six-year-old Hinton Rowan Helper, the outgoing US consul to Buenos Aires, contemplated his fate.<br> <br>Helper tossed and fretted, wracked by what he described as &#x201c;the torture of seasickness&#x201d; and &#x201c;Neptunian nausea.&#x201d; The physical distress mixed with feelings of impatience and disgust as he wondered how long the Lord Clarendon&#x2019;s ceaseless rocking might endure and when he might reach the United States. Then, according to Helper, in the midst of the fourth day of punishment, &#x201c;[at] about 2 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, taxing my mind with redoubled duty to devise a means for others, if not for myself, to travel more pleasantly and expeditiously between far-distant points of our sister continents, the distinct answer to my mental inquiry, a sort of Yankee answer, came like a flash, &#x2018;Why not by rail?&#x2019;?&#x201d;1<br> <br>For an ordinary man, such an outlandish insight might have dissipated, along with the nausea, as soon as the pampero abated. But Helper was anything but ordinary. At the outbreak of the Civil War, shortly before he had departed for Buenos Aires, he was considered &#x201c;the best known and most widely hated man in America.&#x201d;2<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Helper&#x2019;s life had begun unremarkably enough in December 1829. He was the youngest of five children in a middle-class family of mixed English and German origin that had settled in the North Carolina Piedmont. His father had made cabinets and found enough success to afford four slaves but died from the mumps when Helper was barely nine months old. The surviving Helper clan avoided penury through the support of relatives. A teenaged Helper even spent several years at an elite local private school and was developing into what one admirer later described as &#x201c;a very athletic man, above six feet in height, straight as an arrow, and broad-shouldered as a giant.&#x201d; At seventeen, he started apprenticing as a store clerk but soon grew restless and, in a moment of desperation, stole $300 from his employer. The theft, which Helper eventually acknowledged and tried to repay, would haunt him for the rest of his life, though his crime likely provided the funds for his first great adventure outside of North Carolina.3<br> <br>In early 1851, Helper determined to set out for California, a land that the United States had wrested from Mexico three years earlier. A settlement rush had been sweeping California following the discovery of gold at Sutter&#x2019;s Mill in 1848, and Helper had found this excitement irresistible. However, like the countless other easterners trying to get west, he faced a transportation dilemma: no developed overland route connected the settled portions of the United States with its new western holdings. One possible solution for Helper was to join a schooner caravan and risk his life crossing any of several continental trails with origins older than the nation. A second option combined ocean travel with shorter overland crossings through the malarial tropical lowlands of Mexico or Central America. The longest, but seemingly least precarious, itinerary involved an unbroken fifteen-thousand-mile ocean voyage around the entirety of South America.<br> <br>Helper selected this last alternative. His decision appeared wise until midway through the journey, with his ship rounding Cape Horn, when a violent storm struck and, according to Helper, &#x201c;for seven successive days and nights kept us almost completely submerged.&#x201d; A weary Helper finally disembarked at his destination in May 1851, nearly four months after his departure.4<br> <br>Life in the newly settled lands of California, where ethnicities mixed and licentious behavior flourished, differed radically from that of North Carolina. For Helper, who possessed a healthy dose of both southern propriety and racism, moral offense quickly proved easier to find than gold. Moreover, the hard work of prospecting suited his tastes less than the joys of literary pomposity and self-promotion. He returned to North Carolina in 1854, choosing this time to risk an overland crossing in Nicaragua rather than face the potential fury of Cape Horn once more.<br> <br>Helper arrived home short of funds and soon authored a critique of California, Land of Gold: Reality Versus Fiction. The book sold poorly, but the experience left Helper determined to find success as an author, and soon his focus turned to the defining issue of his age, the &#x201c;peculiar institution&#x201d; of slavery, which Helper had recently begun to question. He feared that the forced labor of blacks had both undercut the economic prospects of poor southern whites and impeded the South&#x2019;s ability to industrialize. The dehumanizing treatment of the actual slaves, however, mattered little to Helper, whose racism equaled that of any plantation master.5<br> <br>By the spring of 1857, he had drafted a polemic over four hundred pages long built around data drawn from the last national census. The manuscript, titled The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It, sought to provide an economic counterweight to the moral case put forth five years earlier in Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin. Or, in Helper&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;it is all well enough for women to give the fictions of slavery; men should give the facts.&#x201d; Helper&#x2019;s approach blended abolitionism with racism and used economic reasoning to discard with the ethical and religious argument against slavery popular in New England. Others had previously discussed some of the economic criticisms that Helper employed, but never so systematically and almost never when the author was a proud southerner. The twenty-seven-year-old Helper, a bona fide son of Dixie, child of a slaveholder, had dared to challenge the central institution of his homeland in print.6<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The northern publishing establishment, worried about offending southern readers, shut out Helper entirely until a minor New York book agent agreed to publish The Impending Crisis for an upfront fee.<br> <br>When the book finally appeared in the summer of 1857, scandals came as fast as sales. Across the South, rumors spread of people being lynched or imprisoned on mere suspicion of ownership, and the Dixie press pilloried both the book and its author. One writer even managed to discover Helper&#x2019;s juvenile theft of $300 and painted him as an untrustworthy vagrant.<br> <br>Soon the fracas over Helper spilled into Congress. The controversy there began when a group of nearly seventy northern Republican congressmen signed a petition of support for the beleaguered Helper. This pro-Helper document predictably enraged many southern legislators, who viewed their colleagues&#x2019; action as an unpardonable capitulation to radical sentiments. In late 1859, one of the petition&#x2019;s signatories, Representative John Sherman of Ohio, lost his leading campaign for House Speaker after southerners disqualified anyone who had endorsed Helper&#x2019;s work.7<br> <br>During the subsequent presidential campaign of 1860, an abridged version of Helper&#x2019;s Impending Crisis flooded hotly contested counties throughout the border states. Election results suggested that Lincoln, whose early views on slavery shared more with Helper than with Harriet Beecher Stowe, did particularly well in areas that saw heavy distribution of this abridgment. By the close of 1860, Helper&#x2019;s book had sold over 140,000 copies, and his name had become among the best-known and most divisive in the nation.8<br> <br>For Helper, however, fame brought little success. He earned virtually nothing from The Impending Crisis, and his pariah status left him unemployable throughout the South. He soon appealed directly to Lincoln, seeking a patronage position as reward for his role in the president&#x2019;s victory. Lincoln balked at first, likely fearing the repercussions of a Helper appointment among southern politicians, but in November 1861, seven months after the shelling of Fort Sumter and the outbreak of the Civil War, Helper received a minor appointment as US consul to Buenos Aires, Argentina, then a city of about a hundred thousand people.9<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Only two US-flagged sailing ships at the time offered passenger service from New York to Buenos Aires. The few easterners who traveled to South America typically detoured first through Europe upon foreign-flagged steamers. The Old World powers&#x2014;Great Britain especially&#x2014;controlled commercial and passenger shipping throughout the Western Hemisphere and had created a sort of hub-and-spoke system anchored on the far side of the Atlantic. The patriotic Helper nonetheless insisted that as consul he ought to travel on a US-flagged vessel, even if that meant forgoing the faster and more reliable European steamers.<br> <br>Helper initially anticipated a sea voyage of approximately two months&#x2019; duration, but, as he later explained, &#x201c;prolonged calms . . . and an immoderate superfluity of kelp in the brine&#x201d; turned the journey aboard a US-flagged sailing ship into a ninety-eight-day-long nightmare. The ocean had again betrayed him. He finally landed in Argentina on April 12, 1862.10<br> <br>The inauspicious start to his official tenure nonetheless gave way to one of the happiest times in Helper&#x2019;s life. The European-inspired architecture and culture of Buenos Aires delighted him, and he began courting an Argentine woman reportedly of &#x201c;pure Spanish descent,&#x201d; who had spent five years in the United States and was, according to Helper, &#x201c;as thoroughly American as if she had been born in the Capitol at Washington.&#x201d; They married in early 1863.11<br> <br>Helper&#x2019;s time in Buenos Aires also convinced him of the enormous potential that Latin American markets held for US manufacturers. He spoke of &#x201c;an immense demand&#x201d; and pleaded in dispatches to Washington for the establishment of subsidized steamer service between the New World&#x2019;s two continents. But these entreaties garnered little response, and the same could be said of his frequent requests for a salary increase, a situation that grew increasingly dire as Helper assumed several thousand dollars in debts. Finally, in late 1866, with the Civil War over, his debts increasing, and his salary demands summarily unmet, he tendered his resignation to the State Department.12<br> <br>The prospect of a return sea voyage, however, created a new dilemma for Helper. The two US-flagged ships that earlier traveled to Buenos Aires had disappeared, casualties of a Civil War that had wholly disrupted the meager north&#x2013;south sea trade of the United States. Eventually Helper decided to ride a British-flagged sailing ship named Lord Clarendon, but his oceanic transit turned disastrous for a third time when the pampero struck shortly after his departure from Buenos Aires. This latest misfortune led Helper to imagine his wild alternative, a fantastical vision, a futuristic reverie that seemed ripped from the pages of a Jules Verne novel: a ten-thousand-mile-long hemispheric railway between North and South America.13<br> <br>Helper&#x2019;s outlandish insight stemmed not merely from his personal discomfort and fear, but also from his grandiloquent patriotism. The railway&#x2019;s greatest benefit, in Helper&#x2019;s view, related to a potential impact on US commerce, on helping his nation to gain market share in Latin America. &#x201c;From the very first,&#x201d; Helper later explained, &#x201c;it has been . . . my object to acquire (because geographically and politically and socially and otherwise it belongs to us) the bulk of that vast and rapidly augmenting business. . . . The time has now come for us to reach out into distant lands, and to open avenues abroad for our merchants and manufacturers.&#x201d;14<br> <br>Helper&#x2019;s railway idea aligned with his earlier diplomatic pleas for increased steamship service, but a railway offered benefits to the United States that steamers could never match: an overland travel corridor impervious to European competition; and access to the southern continent&#x2019;s great, resource-rich interior. One newspaper later compared this strategy with &#x201c;the piercing to the centre of the nut at once, extracting the kernel while foreign nations are looking for an opening on the outside.&#x201d;15<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The broader geopolitical objectives that Helper hoped to advance through his hemispheric railway had a history of their own, one that first gained voice in the United States during the late 1810s. At that time, a dispute was under way among the nation&#x2019;s leaders over diplomatic recognition for a wave of independence movements that had spread throughout Spain&#x2019;s colonies in Mexico, Central America, and South America. Those US politicians opposing recognition feared upsetting the Spanish empire or abandoning the nation&#x2019;s professed commitment to neutrality, while those in favor saw a moral imperative to aid potential democracies. But in the opinion of the liberation movements&#x2019; greatest congressional champion, House Speaker Henry Clay of Kentucky, far more than principle stood to be gained.16<br> <br>Clay saw the potential autonomy of Spain&#x2019;s New World colonies through the prism of his own nation&#x2019;s struggle for greatness. When the anti-Spanish agitation had first started to gain international attention around 1810, the United States was already several years into a dispute with England and France over their refusal to let US merchants trade neutrally and safely with all parties. This commercial conflict had sparked a war with England in 1812 that lasted thirty months before the United States emerged victorious. Following this, Clay had become convinced that Spain&#x2019;s rebellious colonies held the key for the United States to forge a new trading system that could replace the one the War of 1812 had largely dismantled.17<br> <br>As he explained in an 1820 speech, &#x201c;It is in our power to create a system of which we shall be the centre, and in which all South America will act with us. . . . Our citizens engaged in foreign trade . . . must take new channels for it, and none so advantageous could be found as those which the trade with South America would afford.&#x201d; The liberated Spanish territories, in Clay&#x2019;s view, would allow the United States to transform from an agrarian satellite of England into the manufacturing and commercial hub of the New World.18<br> <br>The European powers, however, had their own designs for the future of a potentially liberated Spanish empire. Merchants both in England and on the Continent intended to compete aggressively for the Western Hemisphere&#x2019;s trade and to fold any freed Spanish colonies into a European-centered commercial system. Moreover, the proposed Holy Alliance among the Russian Empire, the Austrian Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia seemed disposed to attempt a conquest of any freed Spanish territories during their vulnerable chrysalis from colony to nation.<br> <br>The European political threat troubled Clay as well as many US leaders, including President James Monroe. His administration had started recognizing some of the independence movements in 1822, and the president had no desire to see a fading Spanish empire replaced with rising European powers. Monroe finally addressed this issue directly in a December 1823 speech ...</p><h2>Hot Tubs: How to Build, Maintain &amp; Enjoy Your Own</h2><p>Contents: The Origin of Hot Water and the Descent of Man Into IT; The Wooden Tub; Other Types of Tubs; Plug Your Tub Into the Sun; A Smokeless (But Steamy) Industry Is Born' Hot Tubs, Morals and Sex; Afterword &amp; Forewarning; A Gallery of Hot Tubs and Hot Tubbers.</p><p></p><h2>The Centennial History of the Civil War, Vol. 3: Never Call Retreat</h2><p>The final work in this series begins in December of 1862.

Just as the satisfactory relationship of one person to another results in comfort, peace and joy, so does the satisfactory relationship of ideal proportion and scale. As in relationships, there is stability in proper proportion and scale that leads to pleasure and sensible living, health and ease. My aim in this chapter is to transform the way you see everyday life, as well as what you do and how you live as a result. </p><p>The difference between living and half living is seeing well, looking for associations between things, seeking the connections, being aware of scale and proportion. If it is true that what you seek you find, then it is also true that what you see you find. When you see well, you enjoy the beauty of the world rather than seeing only half the treasures around you. </p><p>Proportion and scale are the tools for achieving this harmonious ideal. Their benevolent effects are all around you. Not too much, not too little. Not too high, not too low. Not too fat, not too thin; not too sweet, not too sour; not too loud, not too faint; not too busy, not too bland; not too garish, not too dull; not too extravagant, not too stingy. We know the world is not perfect. But if we can see ideal proportion -- the relationship of things to themselves -- and if we can see scale -- the size of objects on their own -- we will be better equipped to see that a rich life is out there, ours for the seeing and learning. When you seek the ideal, understanding the relationships among people and objects around you, beauty is wherever you are. </p><p>Let scale and proportion help you to become a seer; with your eyes and brain answering to your own highest conception of the ideal. </p><p>Copyright (c) 1998 by Alexandra Stoddard</p></p><h2>Hair Side, Flesh Side</h2><p>A child receives the body of Saint Lucia of Syracuse for her seventh birthday.

This one volume paperback edition comes complete with an unhelpful introduction from the author, a bonus short story, Young Zaphod Plays It Safe, and a special undeleted scene . . . The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy One Thursday lunchtime the Earth gets unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. For Arthur Dent, who has only just had his house demolished that morning, this seems already to be rather a lot to cope with. Sadly, however, the weekend has only just begun. The Galaxy may offer a mind-boggling variety of ways to be blown up and/or insulted, but it&#39;s very hard to get a cup of tea. The Restaurant at the End of the Universe When all questions of space, time, matter and the nature of being have been resolved, only one question remains - &#39;Where shall we have dinner?&#39; The Restaurant at the End of the Universe provides the ultimate gastronomic experience, and for once there is no morning after to worry about. Life, the Universe and Everything Following a number of stunning catastrophes, Arthur Dent is surprised to find himself living in a hideously miserable cave on prehistoric Earth. However, just as he thinks that things cannot get possibly worse, they suddenly do. An eddy in the space-time continuum lands him, Ford Prefect, and their flying sofa in the middle of the cricket ground at Lord&#39;s, just two days before the world is due to be destroyed by the Vogons. Escaping the end of the world for a second time, Arthur, Ford, and their old friend Slartibartfast embark (reluctantly) on a mission to save the whole galaxy from fanatical robots. Not bad for a man in his dressing gown. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish There is a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. It&#39;s not an easy thing to do, and Arthur Dent thinks he&#39;s the only human who&#39;s been able to master this nifty little trick - until he meets Fenchurch, the woman of his dreams. Fenchurch once realised how the world could be made a good and happy place. Unfortunately, she&#39;s forgotten. Convinced that the secret lies within God&#39;s Final Message to His Creation, they go in search of it. And, in a dramatic break with tradition, actually find it . . . Mostly Harmless Arthur Dent has settled down on the small planet Lamuella and has embraced his role as a Sandwich Maker. However, his plans for a quiet life are thrown awry by the unexpected arrival of his daughter. There&#39;s nothing worse than a frustrated teenager with a copy of the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy in their hands. When she runs away, Arthur goes after her determined to save her from the horrors of the universe. After all - he&#39;s encountered most of them before. This publishing phenomenon began as a radio drama and now exists in a number of wildly contradictory versions (including a TV series, a movie and a towel) - this version, produced by Douglas Adams&#39; original publisher, is, at least, definitively inaccurate.</p><p>Douglas Adams created all the various and contradictory manifestations of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy: radio, novels, TV, computer game, stage adaptations, comic book and bath towel. He lectured and broadcast around the world and was a patron of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and Save the Rhino International. Douglas Adams was born in Cambridge, UK and lived with his wife and daughter in Islington, London, before moving to Santa Barbara, California, where he died suddenly in 2001. In addition to the Hitchhiker series, He is also the author of the Dirk Gently novels: Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic Detective Agency, The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul as well as the non-fiction Last Chance To See and the unfinished The Salmon of Doubt.Hitchhiker's is packed with that unique energy, all barmy and bristling and bold.

Reprint.</p><p>Keith William Nolan has published six previous books on the Vietnam War, including <i>Operation Buffalo</i> and <i>The Magnificent Bastards</i>. As a reviewer of one of his books said, "Nolan is a master of the personal interview. . . . He has the uncanny ability to convey not merely facts, but feelings." Nolan lives and writes in Webster Groves, Missouri.The battle took place on a remote hilltop in Quang Tin Province during the latter days of "Vietnamization," when open defiance of orders was common among GIs. What happened at Firebase Mary Ann the night of March 27-28, 1971, was, according to the author of this riveting account, the U.S. Army's "most blatant and humiliating defeat in Vietnam." That night, 50 sappers of the 409th Viet Cong Main Force Battalion, wearing nothing but shorts, slipped through the base's barbed wire without alerting a single sentry, killed 30 GIs and wounded 82 others. Relying on interviews with survivors and recently declassified documents, Nolan reconstructs the assault from start to finish, showing how a demoralized American unit (1st Battalion, 46th Infantry, Americal Division) was crushed, despite the heroic actions of a few individuals. He traces the chain-of-command process by which the defeat ruined the careers of the division and battalion commanders. By the author of The Magnificent Bastards, this is a perceptive study of poor leadership and combat demoralization. It is also a terrific battle book.

Could versions of books like <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i> or <i>Collusion</i> have been written while the Troubles were ongoing?</p> <p><b>Stuart Neville:</b> No, I definitely couldn't have written <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i> twenty, fifteen or maybe even ten years ago. I've long argued that the best fiction, on page or screen, about any conflict doesn't come along until the conflict is over. We didn't get movies like <i>The Deer Hunter</i> and <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> until the Vietnam War was over, for example. In a more practical sense, <i>Ghosts</i> was more about the aftermath of conflict than the conflict itself, and what happens to those who fought when they're no longer needed by the men of power.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> <i>Collusion</i> was very much a sequel to the first book. Do you think that presented difficulties for readers new to your work? </p><p><b>Neville:</b> Almost all of the comments I've heard have been positive, even for those people who read the books out of order. <i>Collusion</i> is, as you point out, a continuation of the first book, but people seem to be happy to take it on its own terms. I think it works because it's in part a mystery where the protagonist, Jack Lennon, has to figure out what went on in the first book, so if you've not read <i>Ghosts</i>, you follow the mystery with him.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> Did you perceive a difference in the way the books were received in Britain, Ireland and the U.S.?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> Yes, to my surprise. I think the first book in particular was taken more seriously in the U.S., perhaps seen as a more literary thriller, whereas it was seen as more commercial in the U.K. and Ireland. I've been constantly surprised how universally well the first book was received within Ireland, across all sections of society. I had been expecting some flak from certain quarters because of the politics of it, but that never materialized to any significant extent.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> You've spoken of the new book in terms of a departure from what has gone before it. In what way does it differ from the earlier novels?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> For <i>Stolen Souls</i>, I really wanted to take a step away from the heavier political aspects of the first two books and concentrate on writing a thriller whose only purpose was to scare the hell out of the reader. I wanted it to be fast, hitting hard from the first sentence and not letting up until the end, which I hope I've achieved.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> There were obviously elements of <i>Collusion</i> that took place outside Ireland. Do you feel in any way constrained by being regarded as a writer from Northern Ireland? Would you be tempted to look outside the province for plots and material?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> I'll go wherever the story leads me. When I first started writing, I didn't want to write about Northern Ireland, and I especially didn't want to write about the Troubles, but then the idea for <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i> presented itself, and that was that. My next book, <i>Dweller on the Threshold</i>, mostly takes place south of the border in the Republic of Ireland, which is a small change of location, but its action actually spans Europe because that's what the story demanded. I have plans for a future Jack Lennon novel which may have more international locations, but that won't be for a while yet.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> Do you feel that you and a handful of other writers from Northern Ireland are essentially creating a genre as you go, given the absence of models for Irish mystery fiction, and mystery fiction from Northern Ireland in particular?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> Crime writers from anywhere other than London, LA or New York tend to get labels put on them, like Tartan Noir for the Scots and Emerald Noir for the Irish. I tried to coin the term Norn Noir for Northern Irish crime fiction, but it didn't stick. I don't really know if they qualify as genres, though. I guess there are stylistic tics that'll separate out writers from one place or another, but does that make it a genre unto itself? Colin Bateman was the trailblazer for Northern Irish crime fiction, but I don't think anyone who followed him has been able to ape his style. Rather, I think writers like Adrian McKinty have carved out their own styles.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> You're perhaps the best example of an author who used electronic publishing as a way into mainstream publishing. How did that come about? Does it give you a degree of comfort with the changes that are taking place in the industry, or are you concerned by them?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> Technology moves so fast, I think I'm behind the curve already. Yes, it was through blogging and selling short stories to online zines that got my foot in the door. Here we are just three or four years later and everyone has moved on from blogging to Facebook and Twitter. At the same time, there seems to be a lot of fearmongering and panic in certain quarters, and a gold rush mentality in others.

It&#x2019;s a question on which we exert a lot of mental effort&#x2014;often without our even knowing it&#x2014;as its answers have the potential to influence almost everything we do. Unlike many other puzzles we confront, questions of trust don&#x2019;t just involve attempting to grasp and analyze a perplexing concept. They all share another characteristic: risk. So while it&#x2019;s true that we turn our attention to many complex problems throughout our lives, finding the answers to most doesn&#x2019;t usually involve navigating the treacherous landscape of our own and others&#x2019; competing desires. When we&#x2019;re young, asking why the sky is blue or why pizza can&#x2019;t be for dinner every night, though sometimes seeming of equal cosmic importance, necessitates only the transmission of facts to answer. Wondering what exactly a Higgs boson is or whether anything out of the ordinary really happened at Roswell can, it&#x2019;s true, keep the gears of the mind whirring. For most of us, though, attempts to find answers to these questions won&#x2019;t keep us up at night. And while asking our financial advisor for the eighth time how to calculate compound interest might require stepping up our mental math, in and of itself, finding the answer is fairly formulaic. Bring the word <i>trust</i> into the equation, however, and it suddenly becomes a whole different story.</p><p>Trust implies a seeming unknowable&#x2014;a bet of sorts, if you will. At its base is a delicate problem centered on the balance between two dynamic and often opposing desires&#x2014;a desire for someone else to meet your needs and his desire to meet his own. Whether a child can <i>trust</i> her parents&#x2019; answer to her question about the color of the sky requires estimating not only their scientific bona fides, but also their desire to appear smart even if they really don&#x2019;t know the answer. Whether she can <i>trust</i> them to make pizza for dinner, rather than simply ask why she can&#x2019;t have it every night, relies on divining her parents&#x2019; willingness to uphold their promise to cook in the face of sudden needs to work late or to take an extra trip to the grocery store to refill an empty pantry. Whether you can <i>trust</i> scientists to tell you why searching for the Higgs or related subatomic particles is worth the huge taxpayer expense, rather than ask them to simply provide a definition for what the little particle is, means pitting everyone&#x2019;s desire to acquire knowledge that can lead to a better world against the scientists&#x2019; related desires to pad their research budgets. The same logic even applies to trusting yourself. Think about it. Whether you can <i>trust</i> that you&#x2019;ll invest your next paycheck for the long term as opposed to spending it immediately to purchase the newest iPad is quite different from figuring out how much money you&#x2019;ll have in twenty years if you do choose to invest it. Whether we&#x2019;re talking about money, fidelity, social support, business dealings, or secret-keeping, trust isn&#x2019;t just about the facts. It&#x2019;s about trying to predict what someone will do based on competing interests and capabilities. In short, it&#x2019;s about gambling on your ability to read someone&#x2019;s mind, even if that someone is your future self.</p><p>Like all gambles, though, assessing trustworthiness is an imperfect endeavor; there&#x2019;s always a chance you&#x2019;re going to come up short. Sure, most of us have theories about what signals whether people can be trusted. Do they stumble over their words or avert their gaze? Do they seem too &#x201c;smooth&#x201d;? Did they &#x201c;come through&#x201d; last time? The problem, of course, is that most of us have also had the all-too-frequent experience of being surprised when our guesses turned out to be wrong. We&#x2019;re not alone, however; deception &#x201c;experts&#x201d; and security professionals haven&#x2019;t proved much better. Until very recently, there&#x2019;s been precious little evidence indicating that anyone can accurately determine if someone else can be trusted, especially if they don&#x2019;t know the individual well.</p><p>Scientists have spent decades looking for markers of trustworthiness in the body, face, voice, penmanship, and the like, all to little avail. Forget what you see on television; it&#x2019;s all science fiction. If polygraphs were foolproof, we wouldn&#x2019;t need juries. After all, the list of famous criminals who were found guilty based on polygraphs doesn&#x2019;t include the likes of CIA-spy-turned-traitor Aldrich Ames and &#x201c;Green River Killer&#x201d; Gary Ridgway, both of whom &#x201c;passed&#x201d; this physiological test. Likewise, there wouldn&#x2019;t be a long list of people who had to endure false accusations based on failed polygraph tests&#x2014;people like Bill Wegerle of Wichita, Kansas, who was initially suspected of being the BTK killer. Entertaining movies and television shows aside, the same criticisms apply to the use of facial expressions. If a single smile or twitch could accurately predict who could be trusted, all negotiations would occur under a spotlight with video recordings. Science, put simply, doesn&#x2019;t yet have all the answers to unlocking the mysteries of trust. Still, finding the keys is of such importance that the business community and the military spend millions of dollars a year trying to do just that. In fact, current knowledge has been so limited that the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)&#x2014;one of the central research units under the Director of National Intelligence&#x2014;published a notice in 2009 specifically soliciting scientific proposals to develop new and more accurate methods to gauge a target&#x2019;s trustworthiness.</p><p>This state of affairs raises some questions, however: If the need to trust is so central to humans, why is it so difficult to figure out who is worthy of it? Why after millennia of evolutionary development and decades of scientific inquiry are answers only beginning to emerge? To my mind, there are two good reasons. The first, as I&#x2019;ve hinted, is that unlike many forms of communication, issues of trust are often characterized by a competition or battle. As we&#x2019;ll see, it&#x2019;s not always an adaptive strategy to be an open book to others, or even to ourselves. Consequently, trying to discern if someone can be trusted is fundamentally different from trying to assess characteristics like mathematical ability. Aptitude in math can be estimated from answers to specific types of problems. Unless the person is a genius trying to pull the wool over your eyes, there shouldn&#x2019;t be any competing interests pushing her answers one way or another. As a result, her answers should, on average, serve as accurate indicators of her true abilities and be solid predictors of how she&#x2019;ll perform in the future. With trust, neither of these facts is necessarily true. As we&#x2019;ll see throughout this book, deciding to be trustworthy depends on the momentary balance between competing mental forces pushing us in opposite directions, and being able to predict which of those forces is going to prevail in any one instance is a complicated business.</p><p>The second reason why assessing trustworthiness remains something of an enigma is that, to put it bluntly, we&#x2019;ve been going about it in precisely the wrong way. I don&#x2019;t say this lightly, as many great minds have been focused on this topic for decades. Yet it&#x2019;s also the case that this intense focus has led to a tunnel vision of sorts that often results in dead ends among the research community and simplistic expectations among the public. Everyone is looking for the one golden cue that predicts trustworthiness in all situations. Everyone assumes that trustworthiness is a fairly stable trait. Everyone believes that they know when and how issues of trust will affect them. The problem, though, is that they&#x2019;re mostly wrong; trust just doesn&#x2019;t work the way most people think.</p><p>How do I know? I could say, &#x201c;Trust me,&#x201d; but that would defeat the whole point. I&#x2019;m a scientist, so my goal is to convince you based on findings&#x2014;not on opinions or testimonials. I should note that I haven&#x2019;t spent my life as a trust researcher, a security professional, or a science writer. To the contrary, I spend my days running a lab focused on one primary theme: how and why emotional states guide social and moral behavior. It&#x2019;s been an endeavor characterized by both great discoveries and never-ending questions. It&#x2019;s one that has allowed my research group to plumb the depths of the best and worst humanity has to offer. Whether we&#x2019;re uncovering the processes that give rise to dishonesty and hypocrisy or shedding light on the wonders of compassion and virtue, the task at hand always requires a lot of creativity and a willingness to go where the data lead. It&#x2019;s also a job that requires a bit of humility. The longer I do it, the more I realize that the best way to answer perennially difficult questions is not to go it alone, but rather to bring the best minds from many different fields together to look at old problems in new ways. This is exactly the perspective that my group brought to studying trust, and it&#x2019;s one that has allowed us to approach the issue with an entirely new perspective.</p><p>Why the interest in trust<i> </i>in the first place? Primarily because the more we examined vacillations in emotions and moral behavior, the more we realized that trust often played a central role. Whether it&#x2019;s wondering if a partner might cheat, needing to show that you recognize a responsibility to repay a debt, or desiring to signal that your abilities are up to the challenge, issues of trust rear their head. Jealousy and anger often stem from distrust of the loyalty of a partner. Showing gratitude stands as an efficient way to let people know you realize you owe them a favor. Quick flashes of pride can signal people that they can trust your competence. In short, much of human social life, and the emotions that revolve around it, invokes issues of trust in one way or another. Given this fact, my research group turned its lens on the dual aspects of trust&#x2014;both how it works and whether and how people can accurately predict who is worthy of it. In so doing, we began an in-depth and novel investigation that traipsed across many traditionally separate fields of inquiry. In the end, what emerged are not only new insights into how to detect the trustworthiness of others, but also an entirely new way to think about how trust influences our lives, our success, and our interactions with those around us.</p><p>Still, of all the things I learned, one of the most profound&#x2014;and the one I hope you&#x2019;ll take from this book&#x2014;is that trust isn&#x2019;t only a concern that emerges at big moments in our lives. It&#x2019;s not relevant just to signing a contract, making a large purchase, and exchanging wedding vows. Yes, these events certainly affect our lives in important ways and depend on trust, but they&#x2019;re just the tip of the iceberg. Whether we realize it or not, issues of trust permeate our days from the time we&#x2019;re born to the time we die, and it&#x2019;s often what&#x2019;s below the surface of consciousness that can have the greatest influence on a life well lived. Our minds didn&#x2019;t develop in a social vacuum. Humans evolved living in social groups, and that means the minds of our ancestors were sculpted by the challenges posed by living with others on whom they depended. Chief among those challenges was the need to solve dilemmas of trust correctly. And it&#x2019;s precisely because of this fact that the human mind constantly tries to ascertain the trustworthiness of others while also weighing the need to be trustworthy itself. Your conscious experience may not correspond with this fact, but again that&#x2019;s because much of the relevant computations are automatic and take place outside of awareness.</p><p>As you&#x2019;ll see in this book, trust influences more than most of us would have imagined. It affects how we learn, how we love, how we spend, how we take care of our health, and how we maximize our well-being. It not only affects our communication and comfort with others, but as our social worlds change from the physical to the virtual, the role of trust and its impact on our interactions will change as well. I invite you to come on the journey with me to find out exactly what we do and don&#x2019;t know about the role of trust in our lives. Along the way, I&#x2019;ll discuss not only work from my lab that bears on the issue, but also the work, views, and opinions of some of the best thinkers on the topic. From economists and computer scientists, to social media mavens and security officials, to physiologists and psychologists, it&#x2019;ll be a wide-ranging journey designed to put the pieces together.</p><p>To accomplish this goal, I&#x2019;ve loosely divided the book into four parts. The first two chapters will set the stage by laying out the fundamentals&#x2014;what trust is, why it matters, how it&#x2019;s physiologically embodied, and how we might profitably correct older ways of thinking about it. The next three chapters will explore the far-ranging ways trust impacts us&#x2014;from how trust develops and influences children&#x2019;s morality and ability to learn, to the ways trust or lack thereof shapes relationships with those we love, to how and why power and money have the potential to alter loyalties. The sixth chapter turns the tables from an examination of how trust affects behavior to the age-old question of whether and how we can actually detect the trustworthiness of others. Here, I&#x2019;ll flip the old view on its head and open a whole new vista from which to explore trust detection. I&#x2019;ll also point out some bugs in the system, thereby arming you to avoid succumbing to them.</p><p>From this base, the final section&#x2014;chapters 7 and 8&#x2014;will move in a slightly different though no less important direction. Here, I&#x2019;ll consider what all of the preceding means for two relatively novel realms when it comes to trust&#x2014;realms where a partner isn&#x2019;t exactly who, or even what, you&#x2019;d usually expect. Can you trust a virtual avatar? A robot? An unknown person on Facebook? How trust works in a world of rapid technological advancement and virtual interaction&#x2014;a world where the science of trust can be manipulated and used for good or ill with unprecedented precision&#x2014;is the first theme I&#x2019;ll explore. Consideration of the second realm, however, will require adopting a different focus. Rather than looking outward to decide whom you can trust, I&#x2019;ll ask you to direct your gaze inward to ask what may be a more unsettling, yet in many ways a more fundamental, question for reaching your goals: Can you trust yourself? Although it&#x2019;s true that cooperation and vulnerability require two parties, no one ever said that the two parties had to be different people. To the contrary, the parties can be the same person at different times. Can the present you trust the future you not to cheat on your diet by bingeing on chocolate cake? Not to cheat on an exam? Not to cheat on your spouse? Not to go gambling again?</p><p>These last questions highlight a nuance it&#x2019;s important to remember as you proceed through this book. Each of us is never just an observer trying to ascertain whether someone else is to be trusted; we&#x2019;re also targets of observation ourselves. The same forces that determine whether someone else will be honest or loyal also impinge on our own minds. Assessing the trustworthiness of another and acting trustworthy ourselves, then, are simply two sides of the same coin. Understanding how to predict and control the flip of that coin is wha...</p></p><h2>The Rough Guide to Egypt</h2><p>Packed with practical tips on where to find the best hotels, restaurants and bars, this book provides a comprehensive guide for the traveller to Egypt.

They surrounded him, weighed him down, pulled him inexorably into their midst. As uncountable as sea waves and as unsympathetic, they battered him from all sides.<br> <br>Captain Jean-Luc Picard lay on his back, the metal table beneath him once cold and hard, but now beyond his ability to feel. He stared blindly upward, no longer seeing the complex equipment pervading the alien vessel. Numbness suffused his body, a welcome release from the thousand natural shocks to which his flesh had been heir.<br> <br>A glimmer of recognition darted through Picard&#x2019;s awareness. <i>Shakespeare</i>, he thought, grasping for the paraphrased fragment of dialogue, desperate to latch onto something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;familiar. <i>Shakespeare</i>, The Tragedy ... The Tragedy of ...<br> <br><i>William Shakespeare,</i> The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, said a voice in his head&#x2014;said <i>all</i> the voices, knit together as one. Hundreds of Borg&#x2014;perhaps a thousand or more&#x2014;spoke in unison, a chorus of unremitting pressure. Until now, their refrain had articulated only pronouncements of conquest: <i>Strength is irrelevant. Resistance is futile. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own.</i><br> <br>A single voice loosed itself from the whole and spoke to him through the continued din of the aggregate. <i>To die, to sleep&#x2014;no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.</i> The words came in flat tones, devoid of emotion, the cadence robotic. <i>Act Three, Scene One, of</i> Hamlet.<br> <br><i>How do they know that?</i> Picard wondered. Had they extracted the information from his brain, or had they gleaned it from some other source? Even as he posed the question, he understood the answer. Though he and the <i>Enterprise</i> crew had discovered from their first encounter with the Borg that the physically augmented humanoids procreated, it had grown clear just how they added the &#x201c;biological distinctiveness&#x201d; of other species to their own: by brute force. The restraints that bound Picard prevented him from peering down at himself, but earlier he&#x2019;d heard the awful sound of a drill penetrating the side of his skull, he&#x2019;d felt the strange sensation of tubes pushing into newly opened holes in his torso, he&#x2019;d watched a dark, plated mechanism being secured to the right half of his face.<br> <br>And he had begun to hear their voices, no longer without, but within, side by side with his own thoughts. As he resisted, they continued to tell him that he had been chosen to speak for the Borg in all communications, in order to facilitate their introduction into Federation societies. The Borg would make him one of their own, both physically and mentally&#x2014;just as they had with so many others. Their knowledge of Shakespeare had not come from him, but from some other individuals they had incorporated into their hive.<br> <br><i>When did you learn Shakespeare?</i> came another lone voice, barely distinguishable from that of the Borg mass, yet divergent enough to impose a primacy of attention.<br> <br><i>Where did you learn Shakespeare?</i> asked a second.<br> <br><i>Why did you learn Shakespeare?</i> demanded a third.<br> <br>Picard did not intend to respond in any way, but his mind&#x2019;s eye conjured the image of a classroom. He saw himself in school at the age of fourteen, listening to Ms. DeGiglio, his literature instructor. He knew at once that the Borg had in that moment ascertained the answers they&#x2019;d just sought, and more: the appearance and name of his teacher. The mere act of hearing their questions had amounted to an irresistible interrogation.<br> <br>More voices peeled away from the ongoing swell of Borg thought rushing through Picard&#x2019;s mind.<br> <br><i>What else did you learn?</i><br> <br><i>What scientific concepts did you learn?</i><br> <br><i>What scientific applications did you learn?</i><br> <br>Though he made no conscious effort to do so, Picard thought about the warp-field effect, about the equations he&#x2019;d studied during his years at Starfleet Academy. He envisioned the classroom, the campus in San Francisco, diagrams in textbooks, and schematics he&#x2019;d seen in <i>Enterprise</i>&#x2019;s engineering section. Distressed by the idea of the Borg gathering any information at all about Starfleet and its abilities, Picard attempted to blank his mind. He understood that the human brain did not function as a computer did, or even as Data&#x2019;s positronic brain did. The Borg could not simply download his organic intelligence and memory, so that they could then scour the data for useful information, but after connecting their collective mind to his psyche, they could &#x201c;see&#x201d; and &#x201c;hear&#x201d; his waking thoughts. If they could compel him to think of some particular detail, then they could incorporate that detail into their own body of knowledge.<br> <br>Despair washed over Picard like the tide, carried along by the unrelenting voices of the Borg. They had already exhausted his body and his mind, leaving him with a faltering resolve that he knew he couldn&#x2019;t maintain for much longer. He had promised to resist the Borg with his last ounce of strength, but once they had worn him down, what then? It required no guesswork to determine the information they wanted most&#x2014;information he retained as the captain of <i>Enterprise</i>.<br> <br><i>No!</i> Picard cried without opening his mouth. He would not think of his starship. Instead, he struggled to envisage the night sky above his childhood home in La Barre. As a boy, he&#x2019;d often stood out in his family&#x2019;s vineyard, gazing upward and identifying the constellations and stars that so fascinated him. He&#x2019;d spent more than a few nights imagining himself aboard a starship, warping through space.<br> <br><i>Your vessel possesses warp capabilities</i>, stated a Borg voice. <i>What other technologies does it employ?</i><br> <br><i>Cepheus, the constellation of the King</i>, Picard forced himself to think. He recalled the formation of stars from memory. <i>Ursa Minor, the Little Bear,</i> he thought next. <i>Draco, the Dragon.</i><br> <br><i>What are your vessel&#x2019;s armaments?</i><br> <br><i>Alderamin and Errai in Cepheus</i>, Picard recited to himself&#x2014;to himself and to the Borg. <i>Polaris and Kochab in Ursa Minor. Eltanin and&#x2014;</i><br> <br><i>What are your vessel&#x2019;s newest technological developments?</i><br> <br><i>Newest,</i> Picard echoed, the word shining in his mind bright as a nova. <i>Newest</i>, he thought again. <i>The newest technological developments aboard</i> Enterprise.<br> <br>His thoughts drifted backward to&#x2014;when? Hours ago, perhaps? Or had days passed? The perception of time had slipped away from him beneath the constant assault of the Borg intelligence. Still, whenever he had last been aboard <i>Enterprise,</i> he&#x2019;d witnessed firsthand his crew&#x2019;s most recent technological achievement. In a flash, related sights and sounds, thoughts and feelings, emerged from his memory.<br> <br>The Borg saw everything.<br> <br>The turbolift glided to a stop, its doors easing open with a whisper. Captain Picard stepped out onto deck twelve and strode purposefully down the corridor, headed for one of <i>Enterprise</i>&#x2019;s numerous science laboratories. His presence there had been requested by Commander Riker, who had just contacted him about a highly unusual&#x2014;and wholly unauthorized&#x2014;project undertaken by Lieutenant Commander Data. Unclear as to precisely what he would find in the lab, the captain feared the worst-case scenario, already rehearsing what he would say to Starfleet Command in such a circumstance.<br> <br>Picard approached Room 5103 and reached for the door control. The panels parted before him to reveal Riker standing beside Data and Counselor Troi at the periphery of the raised octagonal platform that dominated the space. Lieutenant Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher stood off to one side. Each of the officers faced the experiment chamber at the center of the room, though they all peered over at Picard as he entered. Whatever conversation they might have been having immediately ceased.<br> <br>Gesturing toward the chamber as Picard mounted the platform, Riker said, &#x201c;Captain, this is Data&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d; He hesitated, seeming to search for the appropriate word. &#x201c;&#x2014;creation,&#x201d; he finished.<br> <br>Picard regarded the humanoid figure. Slight of form, perhaps a meter and a half tall, it projected a neutral, unfinished appearance. It wore no clothing, and its bronze skinlike covering showed neither hair nor sexual characteristics. Its nose had no nares. Narrow slits formed its eye sockets and mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lal,&#x201d; Data said, &#x201c;say hello to Captain Jean-Luc Picard.&#x201d;<br> <br>The android looked first to Data, then to Picard. Its head did not turn smoothly, but incrementally, much as Data&#x2019;s often did. &#x201c;Hello, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,&#x201d; it said, its voice possessed of a vaguely electronic quality, not really masculine, not really feminine.<br> <br>Picard did not reply. Of Data, he asked, &#x201c;How similar is this android to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lal is very similar to me,&#x201d; Data said, &#x201c;though I have attempted to improve those design elements I could.&#x201d;<br> <br>Any hope Picard nurtured for an uncomplicated resolution to the situation vanished. He studied the android, and began slowly working his way around the experiment chamber to examine it further. It had not been so long ago that Picard had fought Starfleet to establish Data&#x2019;s own rights as an individual. While a reasonable argument could be made to apply that decision to Data&#x2019;s new creation, the captain doubted that Command would agree so readily.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lal has a positronic brain much like my own,&#x201d; Data continued. &#x201c;I began programming it during my time at the cybernetics conference on Galtinor Prime.&#x201d; Data had attended the conference more than a month earlier.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s ever been able to do that,&#x201d; said La Forge. &#x201c;Not since Doctor Soong programmed you, anyway.&#x201d; Soong had constructed Data three decades earlier, not long before the doctor&#x2019;s death.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is true,&#x201d; Data agreed, &#x201c;but at the conference, I learned of a new sub-micron matrix-transfer technology. The process intrigued me. As I studied it, I discovered that it could be utilized to set up complex neural-net pathways.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you used your brain as a template,&#x201d; Ensign Crusher said, &#x201c;and transferred the setup to Lal&#x2019;s brain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is correct, Wesley,&#x201d; Data said. &#x201c;With this advance, I realized that it would be possible to continue Doctor Soong&#x2019;s work. The initial transfers proved promising, and so I brought Lal&#x2019;s brain back to the <i>Enterprise</i> with me. Several more transfers will be required in order to complete the process.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Picard completed his circuit around the new android, Riker asked, &#x201c;Data, why didn&#x2019;t you tell anybody about this?&#x201d; The question bespoke the captain&#x2019;s own thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a personal experience,&#x201d; Data said. &#x201c;I have not observed members of the crew involving others in their attempts at procreation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker&#x2019;s eyebrows arched as he glanced over at Picard. Data&#x2019;s characterization of his building the android as an act of reproduction signaled an added complexity to what Picard had already assumed would develop into a difficult situation. The captain needed to understand everything he could about Data&#x2019;s invention before the inevitable inquiries from Starfleet Command. &#x201c;Commander Data, I would like to speak with you in my ready room in one hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Commander Riker,&#x201d; Picard said, bidding his first officer to follow him. &#x201c;Counselor.&#x201d; The captain exited, headed back to the bridge, his two officers in tow. Once in the corridor, Picard asked, &#x201c;Why did we not know about this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Technically, Data hasn&#x2019;t done anything wrong,&#x201d; Riker said. &#x201c;He may have conducted his efforts privately, but he didn&#x2019;t violate any regulations about personal, off-duty use of the ship&#x2019;s facilities.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even so,&#x201d; Picard said, &#x201c;his operating in secret precluded the possibility of us preventing this from happening.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he meant to deceive anybody,&#x201d; Troi said. &#x201c;You heard him: he views Lal not as his invention, but as his child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;An outlook we must discourage,&#x201d; Picard said. &#x201c;This android <i>is</i> an invention, <i>not</i> a child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not so sure,&#x201d; Troi said. &#x201c;Is biology necessarily a determining factor in what is and what isn&#x2019;t a child? Data has created an offspring, a separate life based at least partly on his own being. That suggests to me that Lal <i>is</i> his child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A child that can perform sixty trillion calculations a second and could lift me over its head with one arm,&#x201d; Riker observed wryly.<br> <br>&#x201c;An exceptional child, perhaps,&#x201d; Troi said, &#x201c;but a child nonetheless.&#x201d;<br> <br>The trio arrived at a turbolift and entered. The captain specified their destination, and the car started upward. Thinking beyond the new android&#x2019;s capabilities, it occurred to Picard that Data&#x2019;s motivations might help inform the situation. &#x201c;Counselor, I&#x2019;m recollecting Data&#x2019;s experiences during the past couple of months. Could his decision to do this be a reaction to what happened on the <i>Jovis</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean his abduction by Kivas Fajo?&#x201d; Troi asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;And the faking of his death,&#x201d; Picard said. Fajo, a Zibalian trader and a collector of rare and valuable items, had staged a shuttle accident in order to cover his kidnapping and detention of Data. &#x201c;Could his facing indefinite confinement have contributed to his desire to construct another of his own kind? Or could his potentially having to kill his captor in order to escape captivity have contributed?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible,&#x201d; Troi allowed, though with a tone of skepticism. &#x201c;Post-traumatic stress can sometimes drive individuals to life-affirming actions, such as having a child. But I think such circumstances imply the presence of emotion, so I&#x2019;m not sure this would explain Data&#x2019;s behavior.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The conference was postponed a few months because of severe weather around the cybernetics center on Galtinor Prime,&#x201d; Riker said. &#x201c;Do you think if it had taken place as originally scheduled, prior to the incident with Fajo, that Data still would have constructed Lal?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Provided that the technology he learned about was available at that time,&#x201d; Troi said, &#x201c;yes, I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>The turbolift reached the bridge, depositing Picard and his officers on the lower level, beside the door to the captain&#x2019;s ready room. &#x201c;Counselor,&#x201d; Picard said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to look into that more. See if there&#x2019;s any basis for post-traumatic stress and related actions without an emotional component.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Troi said. She padded across to her position.<br> <br>&#x201c;Number One,&#x201d; Picard said, and entered his ready room. Riker followed. Inside, the captain crossed to his desk and took his chair. His first officer sat down opposite.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will, do you still have whatever research you conducted for the hearing on Starbase One-Seven-Three?&#x201d; Picard asked. A year and a half earlier, Commander Bruce Maddox, a cyberneticist attached to the Daystrom Technological Institute, had moved to dismantle and reverse-engineer Data. Maddox hoped thereby to complete his own research so that he could then manufacture Soong-type androids for Starfleet.

In addition to being an icon of stage and screen large and small, Price was also an avid art collector, a gourmand, a dashing and relentless charmer, and a loving father. His daughter Victoria was born shortly before Price turned 51, at the height of his popularity. Though the star's busy film schedule took him in and out of his young daughter's life, he was always a larger-than-life presence and, simply, her father. <br><br>Victoria adored him, and despite his harrowing schedule, their relationship was close. That is, until Price married his third wife, the headstrong and independent actress, Coral Browne. Victoria was a girl of twelve, and her new stepmother resented the strong relationship between father and daughter, and consequently did much to keep the two apart. Late in Price's life, however, he and his daughter were brought together again for some of their most memorable time together. <br><br>In this elegant biography-cum-memoir, Victoria Price reveals a man both complex and human. An actor of range, he starred in both the film noir milestone Laura and the Biblical classic The Ten Commandments. As a "pre-war anti Nazi sympathizer," he was greylisted during the Red Scare of the 1950s-until, in a desperate gesture, he signed a secret oath that saved his career. And his passion for the arts gave him a second life as an erudite columnist and collector, even as his films graced drive-ins nationwide. Victoria Price's account life of her father is full and candid; both his passionate and charismatic public persona and his conflicted inner life are treated with curiosity and understanding.<br><br><i>Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography</i> is, in short, the thorough-and uniquely intimate-life of a legend.<br></p><p>Those who only think of Vincent Price as the deliciously evil star of numerous horror films are in for an enjoyable surprise with Victoria Price's <i>Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography</i>. The younger Price, through a dedicated search of clippings, letters, and her father's old journals, paints a beautifully rich portrait of a man with personal grace, intellectual fire, and a kind heart. Price reveals everything from odd little tidbits--Vincent was cast in his first London stage production due to his gum-chewing abilities--to profound depths, such as his lifelong love of art and his serious reputation as a student and collector. Price also had a surprisingly good sense of humor, indulging in genially self-deprecating jokes about his own occasionally abysmal movies. <p>Though this is definitely a loving memoir of her father, Victoria Price is not blinded by her affection for him. She gives an earnest attempt at presenting the whole man--fact-checking and debunking a few cherished family legends and unflinchingly reporting her father's youthful anti-Semitism. (As Price grew more worldly and met some actual Jews, he reversed his position and became an active supporter of B'nai Brith and the Jewish Anti-Defamation League.) But <i>A Daughter's Autobiography</i>'s may best value may be as a handbook for actors: through the numerous ups and downs of his career, Price remained a consummate professional. He never stopped working to improve his skills, deliberately sidestepping romantic-lead parts to take on more challenging roles, and was unfailingly generous to his costars. A truly engrossing look at the noble character of one of the silver screen's greatest villains. <i>--Ali Davis</i></p>Victoria Price is a television screenwriter, and is also at work on a study of Ranier Maria Rilke and his circle. She lives in Santa Fe, NM.<br></p><h2>I&#39;ll Think about That Tomorrow</h2><p>The author describes her shattered dream marriage to jazzman Artie Shaw and her growth from lonely, middle-aged divorcee to independent woman</p><p>Like its predecessor, Scarlett O'Hara's Younger Sister, this sequel concentrates on Keyes's drive to succeed as a performer, writer and lover. After her divorce from her last husband, Artie Shaw, the author explored career possibilities in England and Hollywood although she was aware that roles available to actresses in their later years were limited. She finally made a hit as the star in a U.S. touring company of No, No Nanette in 1987. Keyes goes on at length about the trials of no longer being "the baby," as she refers to her plum roles in films during the 1930s and '40s. While aiming at a light tone, she is so self-involved that even her humor becomes tiresome. She mentions other people--spouses Shaw, Charles Vidor and John Huston, and lovers including Mike Todd--mostly as they affected her.

He had received every major honor for mystery fiction; awards ranging from the Navajo Tribal Council's commendation to France 's esteemed <em>Grand prix de litterature policiere. </em>Western Writers of America honored him with the Wister Award for Lifetime achievement in 2008. He served as president of the prestigious Mystery Writers of America, and was honored with that group&#x2019;s Edgar Award and as one of mystery fiction&#x2019;s Grand Masters. In 2001, his memoir, <em>Seldom Disappointed, </em>won both the Anthony and Agatha Awards for best nonfiction.</p>Capturing the listener with his soft drawl, Tony Hillerman reads stories based on real-life events in Taos and other areas of New Mexico. He expertly adds personal flair and deep feelings to his stories, including a lot of humor and good-natured comments about the land and the people. During some of the stories Hillerman seems to be speaking directly to the listener. Hearing the author read allows the listener to learn a little about Hillerman the man, as well as the country he so obviously loves. His performance adds immensely to the value of these stories.

Working in this high-speed medium, the painter cannot hesitate, and he rarely gets a chance to change his mind. He must know how his colors will behave before he starts. Now, the noted western watercolorist Tom Hill has revised his highly successful book Color for the Watercolor Painter. The new material is of the same high quality as that in the first edition. He reviews basic materials, tools, and watercolro techniques, discusses color theory in simple down-to-earth terms, and evaluates the most useful tube colors, describing how each color behaves and how best to use it. He describes how to achieve textural effects, how to mix colors, how to choose color palettes (warm, cool, low-key, high-key, tonal, minimum) for various purposes and how to create the effects of distance and atmosphere through color. And in a series of full-color step-by-step demonstration projects, he illustrates how to use color effectively in landscapes, seascapes, floral paintings, portraits, and figure paintings. In addition, the revised edition contains 32 completely new full-color pages in which Hill discusses color intensity versus color value, how to mix different complements, opacity versus transparency, and relationships of warm and cool, warm and warm, and cool and cool. He also describes mixing with a minimum number of colors, mixing color while painting, graying colors, intensifying colors, staining and tinting, painting with just two colors, and bouncing colors (picking up reflected light)....&#34; 160 pages, 8.25 x 11 inches, 48 full-color pages, 84 black-and-white illustrations, Bibliography, Index.</p><p></p><h2>Collective Intelligence: Mankind&#39;s Emerging World in Cyberspace</h2><p>Argues that the technology of cyberspace will have a positive, humanizing influence on civilization, rather than creating a world where machines rule mankind</p><p>Pierre Levy sees us as moving past an information economy into an economy based on human interactions; a social economy. While the idea may seem startling, given our current emphasis on all things monetary, his reasoning makes you stop and give careful thought to ideas you may not have considered before. As technology advances, Levy points out, it's capable of taking on more and more advanced tasks--first simple labor and now the processing of information. As these capabilities become easier and well within everyone's reach, their value declines.<p> But the one thing that is beyond the reach of pure technology is the construction and maintenance of social interactions. What technology <i>can</i> do, however, is make it easier for humans to interact over greater distances and around obstacles. "Our humanity," Levy writes, "is the most precious thing we have." Levy, who is a professor in the department of hypermedia at the University of Paris, then predicts that we will take greater control of that value and everything related to it as we use technology to organize ourselves into what he calls Living Cities. Here, physical location is less important than the interactions of its members, and not surprisingly, the lack of territorialities will challenge present methods of governance.</p><p> Levy insists we are in the early moments of an historical paradigm shift of the magnitude of the Renaissance. And yet he avoids wild utopianism, keeping a clear eye on the realities and challenges inherent in any great transformation, complete with ample opportunities for things to go wrong. What emerges, however, is a different way of viewing the possible future, and plenty of reasons for asking why this utopian vision isn't attainable.</p><b>Pierre L�vy</b> is a professor in the Department of Hypermedia at the University of Paris-VIII, scientific advisor to the TriVium company, and member of the advisory board of the Pompidou Center's Virtual Review.

Annie Proulx). <br></p><p>Lois-Ann Yamanaka is a contributor for the following Houghton Mifflin Company Title: Wild Meat and the Bully BurgersIn her debut novel, the author presents the history of a Japanese American family living in Hawaii in the 1970s. The narrator, Lovey Nariyoshi, tells her story of growing up in a white ("haole") culture that keeps her family segregated. "No japs on TV," observes Lovey, "except Mrs. Livingston and Kay-to." This engrossing novel is strongly woven together, with chapters that swing from the heartfelt, childhood memories of Lovey's father, Hubert, to the fiendish behavior of her neighbors. Hawaiian Creole is dispersed effectively with English, further corroborating the fervent characters and their stories. By focusing decisively on her own distinct culture, the author successfully uncovers the damaging restrictions of American culture at large. This commanding novel should delight and haunt every reader. Unconditionally recommended for every library collection.?David A. Berona, Westbrook Coll.

The cog wheels in the rotating tower high above him chattered and squealed like angry ratbirds, and a shaft of light cut through the dusty air. The academic levelled the brush in his other hand and tilted his head to one side, his pale yellow eyes fixed on the youth before him.<br><br>&#x2018;A little more to the left now, I think, Master Quint,&#x2019; he said, his voice soft but insinuating. &#x2018;So the light catches you. Just so . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Quint did as he was told. The early morning light streaming in from the high tower window fell across his face, glinting on his cheekbones, the tips of his ears and nose and, with its rusting pipes and gauges, the battered armour he wore.<br><br>&#x2018;Excellent, my young squire,&#x2019; the academic muttered approvingly. He dipped the tip of the hammelhornhair brush into the white paint on his palette and dabbed lightly at the tiny painting on the easel before him. &#x2018;Now we must let the light work its magic,&#x2019; he murmured. The dabbing continued. &#x2018;The highlights complete the picture, Master Quint. But I must insist that you hold still.&#x2019;<br><br>Quint tried to maintain the pose &#x2013; but it wasn&#x2019;t easy. The tower was small and airless, and the heady odours from the pigments, the pinewood oils and the thinning varnishes were combining to make his eyes water and his head ache. The rusty, ill-fitting armour chafed his neck, and his left leg had gone quite numb. Besides, he was dying to see the finished portrait. It was all he could do not to turn right round and inspect it for himself.<br><br>&#x2018;The dawn light,&#x2019; clucked the academic. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s nothing like it for illuminating the subject . . .&#x2019; His pale yellow eyes darted back and forth over Quint&#x2019;s features. &#x2018;And what an illustrious subject we are, my young squire.&#x2019;<br><br>He chuckled, and Quint tried not to blush.<br><br>&#x2018;The prot�g� of none other than the Most High Academe of Sanctaphrax . . .&#x2019; He turned away and began stabbing at the palette like a woodthrush after a spanglebug. &#x2018;How lucky you are, Master Quint, not to have to scrabble about with the rest of us in the minor schools, but to be given a place at the most prestigious academy of them all. I wonder . . .&#x2019; The academic&#x2019;s voice was laden with sudden spite. &#x2018;I wonder what you actually did to deserve it?&#x2019;<br><br>The academic&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on Quint&#x2019;s face once more. They were so pale that there was almost no difference between the irises and the yellowish white that surrounded them. It was a mark of his trade, Quint told himself, trying not to shudder. Just as years of working as an Undertown rope-turner resulted in spatula-shaped fingers, and just as a slaughterer tanner from the Deepwoods ended up with skin the colour of blood, so, as the years passed, the eyes of Sanctaphrax portraitists were gradually bleached by the vapours of the thinning varnishes they used &#x2013; and Ferule Gleet had been a portraitist for many, many years.<br><br>&#x2018;I was the Most High Academe&#x2019;s apprentice . . .&#x2019; Quint looked down, his cheeks blazing as he remembered the monstrous gloamglozer and the night of the terrible fire.<br><br>&#x2018;Keep still!&#x2019; rasped Gleet, irritatedly dabbing at the portrait. &#x2018;Ah, yes,&#x2019; he smiled thinly. &#x2018;There was that fire at the Palace of Shadows, wasn&#x2019;t there? Strange and dreadful business . . . How is the Most High Academe? Recovering well, I hope.&#x2019;<br><br>The pale yellow eyes bored into Quint&#x2019;s once more.<br><br>&#x2018;As well as can be expected,&#x2019; the youth replied, but the words rang hollow in his ears as he thought of his mentor lying in the gloomy bedchamber at the School of Mist.<br><br>Linius Pallitax had suffered grievously at the hands of the terrible gloamglozer. He had almost been destroyed. Perhaps it would have been better if he had, for now he never left his bed, and his haunted eyes stared into the distance, seeing neither his faithful servant, Tweezel, nor Quint, his apprentice &#x2013; nor even his own daughter, Maris, who sat beside him for so many hours, praying for him to recover.<br><br>Ferule Gleet daubed at the tiny painting in silence for a moment.<br><br>&#x2018;As well as can be expected, eh?&#x2019; he mused at last. &#x2018;Doesn&#x2019;t sound too good. You wouldn&#x2019;t want anything to happen to him, my fine young squire. Not in your position.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;My position?&#x2019; said Quint, trying not to move.<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re the High Academe&#x2019;s prot�g�, aren&#x2019;t you? Without him, you don&#x2019;t expect that the Knights Academy would accept you into its hallowed halls, do you? Of course not!&#x2019; Ferule shook his head. &#x2018;Sanctaphrax born and bred, that&#x2019;s always been the rule. The rest of us have to get by at the minor academies as best we can.&#x2019;<br><br>He wiped his brush on a piece of rag, and turned the easel round.<br><br>&#x2018;There,&#x2019; he announced.<br><br>Quint found himself staring at the miniature painting of a young knight academic in gleaming armour, with deep indigo eyes and a smile on his face. Ferule Gleet of the School of Colour and Light Studies had done a fine job all right. Quint shivered.<br><br>&#x2018;Is anything wrong?&#x2019; Ferule asked.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s nothing,&#x2019; Quint said quietly.<br><br>He had no intention of telling the pale-eyed academic about the memories the miniature painting had stirred &#x2013; memories of the first time he&#x2019;d had his portrait done.<br><br>How young he&#x2019;d been then. Four, maybe five years old; the youngest of six brothers. His father, Wind Jackal, had commissioned the mural of the whole family for the grand hall of their palace in the Western Quays. What happy days they&#x2019;d been. But they hadn&#x2019;t lasted, he thought bitterly.

Mr. Nelson lives with his family in San Diego, California.A song by children&#x2019;s folk-singer Staines is brought to rollicking life by Nelson&#x2019;s artwork in this howl-along picture book. The refrain begins All God&#x2019;s critters got a place in the choir, / some sing low, some sing higher, / some sing out loud on the telephone wire. The tune then moves into solo and ensemble performances by dogs and cats and cows and hippos and possums and porcupines and on and on, adding their own voices and personalities to the hubbub. In each delightful spread, full-to-bursting with said critters&#x2019; energy, Nelson proves himself to be as adept painting jubilant scenes of barnyard animals raising a ruckus as he is creating the more gravitas-laden artwork for which he is justly celebrated. The oversize type of the lyrics nearly shouts off the page, making this a great choice for groups of excitable singers; but it works just as well on an individual level, allowing children to point out the various animals while mimicking their joyful noise. Be sure to keep this book far, far away at bedtime, though. Preschool-Grade 1. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>Lenin&#x2019;s Last Struggle</h2><p><p>One of the great political strategists of his era, V. I. Lenin continues to attract historical interest, yet his complex personality eludes full understanding. This new edition of Moshe Lewin's classic political biography, including an afterword by the author, suggests new approaches for studying the Marxist visionary and founder of the Soviet state. Lenin's Last Struggle offers invaluable insights into the rise of the Bolshevik party and the Soviet Union, a saga complicated by complex strategic battles among the leaders of Lenin's generation: leaders whose names are universally known, but whose personalities and motivations are even now not sufficiently understood.</p><p>Moshe Lewin was a collective farm worker in the USSR and a soldier in the Soviet army. He later became director of studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris, a fellow of the Kennan Institute, a senior fellow of Columbia University's Russian Institute, and is now emeritus professor of history at The University of Pennsylvania.</p></p><p>Moshe Lewin is Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of several books on Soviet history.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Edge of Memory: Ancient Stories, Oral Tradition and the Post-Glacial World (Bloomsbury Sigma)</h2><p><p>In <i>The Edge of Memory</i>, Patrick Nunn explores the science in folk history. He looks at ancient tales and traditions that may be rooted in scientifically verifiable fact, and can be explored via geological evidence, such as the Biblical Flood.</p><p>We all know those stories that have been told in our families for generations. The ones that start "Have I ever told you about your great, great Uncle ...?" In some cultures these stories have been passed down for thousands of years, and often reveal significant information about how the surrounding environment has changed and the effect it has had on societies--from stories referring to coastal drowning to the devastation caused by meteorite falls.</p><p>Take Australian folklore, for instance. People arrived in Australia more than 60,000 years ago, and the need to survive led to the development of knowledge that was captured orally in stories passed down through the generations. These stories conveyed both practical information and recorded history, and they frequently made reference to a coastline that was very different to the one we recognize today. In at least 21 different communities along the fringe of Australia, flood stories were recorded by European anthropologists, missionaries, and others. They described a lost landscape that is now under as much as 100 feet of ocean. And these folk traditions are backed up by hard science. Geologists are now starting to corroborate the tales through study of climatic data, sediments and land forms; the evidence was there in the stories, but until recently, nobody was listening.</p><p><i>The Edge of Memory</i> is an important book that explores the wider implications for our knowledge of how human society has developed through the millennia.</p></p><p><p><b>Patrick Nunn</b> received his PhD from the University of London before spending 25 years teaching and researching at the international University of the South Pacific, based in Fiji, where he was appointed Professor of Oceanic Geoscience in 1996.

Some are old, some are young, all have come late to music or come back to it after a long absence. This is the Late Starters Orchestra--the bona fide amateur string orchestra where Ari Goldman pursues his lifelong dream of playing the cello. <br><br>Goldman hadn&#x2019;t seriously picked up his cello in twenty-five years, but the Late Starters (its motto, If you think you can play, you can) seemed just the right orchestra for this music lover whose busy life had always gotten in the way of its pursuit.<br><br>In <i>The Late Starters Orchestra,</i> Goldman takes us along to LSO rehearsals and lets us sit in on his son&#x2019;s Suzuki lessons, where we find out that children do indeed learn differently from adults. He explores history&#x2019;s greatest cellists and also attempts to understand what motivates his fellow late starters, amateurs all, whose quest is for joy, not greatness. And when Goldman commits to playing at his upcoming birthday party we wonder with him whether he&#x2019;ll be good enough to perform in public. To the rescue comes the ghost of Goldman&#x2019;s first cello teacher, the wise and eccentric Mr. J, who continues to inspire and guide him--about music and more--through this well-tuned journey. <br><br>With enchanting illustrations by Eric Hanson, <i>The Late Starters Orchestra</i> is about teachers and students, fathers and sons, courage and creativity, individual perseverance and the power of community. And Ari Goldman has a message for anyone who has ever had a dream deferred: it&#x2019;s never too late to find happiness on one&#x2019;s own terms.</p></p><p><p><b>&#x201c;Candid, wise, and inspiring.&#x201d;*</b><br><br>&#x201c;Warm, soulful, sometimes rueful, sometimes passionate.

Every feature was planned by God with design and purpose. Because of God&#x2019;s plan that the Tabernacle would be fulfilled in Christ, both in its structure as well as in its function, it can be said that this book is more about Christ than the Tabernacle. As readers tour this amazing interpretive construction with Hershberger, they will be delighted to see figures of Christ where they least expected to find them. The smallest details are given significance in this great symbolic foreshadowing of Christ and His Church. This book has served many through personal studies and group studies. Every preacher and Bible teacher could benefit from this well thought out study.</p><p>Ervin N. Hershberger was an energetic and diligent student of Scripture. In his lifetime, he wrote many articles for publication. He was the founding editor of Calvary Messenger and served in that capacity for many years. He also taught at Calvary Bible School in Arkansas in many of his active years. His teaching specialty was the Old Testament and the study of the Tabernacle. He was active as deacon in his church until his age and health caused him to lay the work down. Hershberger had a love for people, especially young people.

His eyes were bulging from behind his steel-rimmed glasses, he had plastered one hand over his face so that his palm was partially cupping his mouth, and his neck could have been on ball-bearings the way he was craning back over his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop the car, Dennis! Go back!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go back, I want to look at her again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly I understood. &#x201c;Oh, man, forget it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you mean that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thing we just passed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go back!&#x201d; He was almost screaming.<br> <br>I went back, thinking that it was maybe one of Arnie&#x2019;s subtle little jokes. But it wasn&#x2019;t. He was gone, lock, stock, and barrel. Arnie had fallen in love.<br> <br>She was a bad joke, and what Arnie saw in her that day I&#x2019;ll never know. The left side of her windshield was a snarled spiderweb of cracks. The right rear deck was bashed in, and an ugly nest of rust had grown in the paint-scraped valley. The back bumper was askew, the trunk-lid was ajar, and upholstery was bleeding out through several long tears in the seat covers, both front and back. It looked as if someone had worked on the upholstery with a knife. One tire was flat. The others were bald enough to show the canvas cording. Worst of all, there was a dark puddle of oil under the engine block.<br> <br>Arnie had fallen in love with a 1958 Plymouth Fury, one of the long ones with the big fins. There was an old and sun-faded FOR SALE sign propped on the right side of the windshield&#x2014;the side that was not cracked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at her lines, Dennis!&#x201d; Arnie whispered. He was running around the car like a man possessed. His sweaty hair flew and flopped. He tried the back door on the passenger side, and it came open with a scream.<br> <br>&#x201c;Arnie, you&#x2019;re having me on, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s sunstroke, right? Tell me it&#x2019;s sunstroke. I&#x2019;ll take you home and put you under the frigging air conditioner and we&#x2019;ll forget all about this, okay?&#x201d; But I said it without much hope. He knew how to joke, but there was no joke on his face then. Instead, there was a kind of goofy madness I didn&#x2019;t like much.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t even bother to reply. A hot, stuffy billow of air, redolent of age, oil, and advanced decomposition, puffed out of the open door. Arnie didn&#x2019;t seem to notice that, either. He got in and sat down on the ripped and faded back seat. Once, twenty years before, it had been red. Now it was a faded wash pink.<br> <br>I reached in and pulled up a little puff of upholstery, looked at it, and blew it away. &#x201c;Looks like the Russian army marched over it on their way to Berlin,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He finally noticed I was still there. &#x201c;Yeah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yeah. But she could be fixed up. She could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she could be tough. A moving unit, Dennis. A beauty. A real&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here! Here! What you two kids up to?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was an old guy who looked as if he was enjoying&#x2014;more or less&#x2014;his seventieth summer. Probably less. This particular dude struck me as the sort of man who enjoyed very little. His hair was long and scraggy, what little there was left of it. He had a good case of psoriasis going on the bald part of his skull.<br> <br>He was wearing green old man&#x2019;s pants and lowtopped Keds. No shirt; instead there was something cinched around his waist that looked like a lady&#x2019;s corset. When he got closer I saw it was a back brace. From the look of it I would say, just offhand, that he had changed it last somewhere around the time Lyndon Johnson died.<br> <br>&#x201c;What you kids up to?&#x201d; His voice was shrill and strident.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, is this your car?&#x201d; Arnie asked him. Not much question that it was. The Plymouth was parked on the lawn of the postwar tract house from which the old man had issued. The lawn was horrible, but it looked positively great with that Plymouth in the foreground for perspective.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if it is?&#x201d; The old guy demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x201d;&#x2014;Arnie had to swallow&#x2014;&#x201c;I want to buy it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old dude&#x2019;s eyes gleamed. The angry look on his face was replaced by a furtive gleam in the eye and a certain hungry sneer around the lips. Then a large resplendent shit-eating grin appeared. That was the moment, I think&#x2014;then, just at that moment&#x2014;when I felt something cold and blue inside me. There was a moment&#x2014;just then&#x2014;when I felt like slugging Arnie and dragging him away. Something came into the old man&#x2019;s eyes. Not just the gleam; it was something behind the gleam.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you should have said so,&#x201d; the old guy told Arnie. He stuck out his hand and Arnie took it. &#x201c;LeBay&#x2019;s the name. Roland D. LeBay. U.S. Army, retired.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Arnie Cunningham.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old sport pumped his hand and sort of waved at me. I was out of the play; he had his sucker. Arnie might as well have handed LeBay his wallet.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d; Arnie asked. And then he plunged ahead. &#x201c;Whatever you want for her, it&#x2019;s not enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>I groaned inside instead of sighing. His checkbook had just joined his wallet.<br> <br>For a moment LeBay&#x2019;s grin faltered a little, and his eyes narrowed down suspiciously. I think he was evaluating the possibility that he was being put on. He studied Arnie&#x2019;s open, longing face for signs of guile, and then asked the murderously perfect question:<br> <br>&#x201c;Son, have you ever owned a car before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He owns a Mustang Mach II,&#x201d; I said quickly. &#x201c;His folks bought it for him. It&#x2019;s got a Hurst shifter, a supercharger, and it can boil the road in first gear. It&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Arnie said quietly. &#x201c;I just got my driver&#x2019;s license this spring.&#x201d;<br> <br>LeBay tipped me a brief but crafty gaze and then swung his full attention back to his prime target. He put both hands in the small of his back and stretched. I caught a sour whiff of sweat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got a back problem in the Army,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Full disability. Doctors could never put it right. Anyone ever asks you what&#x2019;s wrong with the world, boys, you tell em it&#x2019;s three things: Doctors, commies, and nigger radicals. Of the three, commies is the worst, closely followed by doctors. And if they want to know who told you, tell em Roland D. LeBay. Yessir.&#x201d;<br> <br>He touched the old, scuffed hood of the Plymouth with a kind of bemused love.<br> <br>&#x201c;This here is the best car I ever owned. Bought her in September 1957. Back then, that&#x2019;s when you got your new model year, in September. All summer long they&#x2019;d show you pictures of cars under hoods and cars under tarps until you were fair dyin t&#x2019;know what they looked like underneath. Not like now.&#x201d; His voice dripped contempt for the debased times he had lived to see. &#x201c;Brand-new, she was. Had the smell of a brand-new car, and that&#x2019;s about the finest smell in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>He considered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Except maybe for pussy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at Arnie, nibbling the insides of my cheeks madly to keep from braying laughter all over everything. Arnie looked back at me, astounded. The old man appeared to notice neither of us; he was off on his own planet.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was in khaki for thirty-four years,&#x201d; LeBay told us, still touching the hood of the car. &#x201c;Went in at sixteen in 1923. I et dust in Texas and seen crabs as big as lobsters in some o them Nogales whoredens. I saw men with their guts comin out their ears during Big Two. In France I saw that. Their guts was comin out their ears. You believe that, son?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yessir,&#x201d; Arnie said. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d heard a word LeBay said. He was shifting from foot to foot as if he had to go to the bathroom bad. &#x201c;About the car, though&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You go to the University?&#x201d; LeBay barked suddenly. &#x201c;Up there at Horlicks?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nosir, I go to Libertyville High.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; LeBay said grimly. &#x201c;Steer clear of colleges. They&#x2019;re full of niggerlovers that want to give away the Panama Canal. &#x2018;Think-tanks,&#x2019; they call em. &#x2018;Asshole-tanks,&#x2019; say I.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gazed fondly at the car sitting on its flat tire, its paintjob mellowing rustily in the late afternoon sunlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurt my back in the spring of &#x2019;57,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Army was going to rack and ruin even then. I got out just in time. I came on back to Libertyville. Looked over the rolling iron. I took my time. Then I walked into Norman Cobb&#x2019;s Plymouth dealership&#x2014;where the bowling alley is now on outer Main Street&#x2014;and I ordered this here car. I said you get it in red and white, next year&#x2019;s model. Red as a fire-engine on the inside. And they did it. When I got her, she had a total of six miles on the odometer. Yessir.&#x201d;<br> <br>He spat.<br> <br>I glanced over Arnie&#x2019;s shoulder at the odometer. The glass was cloudy, but I could read the damage all the same: 97,432. And six-tenths. Jesus wept.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you love the car so much, why are you selling it?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>He turned a milky, rather frightening gaze on me. &#x201c;Are you cracking wise on me, son?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t answer, but I didn&#x2019;t drop my gaze either.<br> <br>After a few moments of eye-to-eye duelling (which Arnie totally ignored; he was running a slow and loving hand over one of the back fins), he said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t drive anymore. Back&#x2019;s gotten too bad. Eyes are going the same way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly I got it&#x2014;or thought I did. If he had given us the correct dates, he was seventy-one. And at seventy, this state makes you start taking compulsory eye exams every year before they&#x2019;ll renew your driver&#x2019;s license. LeBay had either failed his eye exam or was afraid of failing. Either way, it came to the same thing. Rather than submit to that indignity, he had put the Plymouth up. And after that, the car had gotten old fast.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much do you want for it?&#x201d; Arnie asked again. Oh, he just couldn&#x2019;t wait to be slaughtered.<br> <br>LeBay turned his face up to the sky, appearing to consider it for rain. Then he looked down at Arnie again and gave him a large, kindly smile that was far too much like the previous shit-eating grin for me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asking three hundred,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you seem a likely enough lad. I&#x2019;ll make it two-fifty for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my Christ,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>But he knew who his sucker was, and he knew exactly how to drive the wedge in between us. In the words of my grandfather, he hadn&#x2019;t fallen off a haytruck yesterday.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said brusquely. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s how you want it. I got my four-thirty story to watch. Edge of Night. Never miss it if I can help it. Nice chinning with you boys. So long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Arnie threw me such a smoking look of pain and anger that I backed off a step. He went after the old man and took his elbow. They talked. I couldn&#x2019;t hear it all, but I could see more than enough. The old man&#x2019;s pride was wounded. Arnie was earnest and apologetic. The old man just hoped Arnie understood that he couldn&#x2019;t stand to see the car that had brought him through safe to his golden years insulted. Arnie agreed. Little by little, the old man allowed himself to be led back. And again I felt something consciously dreadful about him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was as if a cold November wind could think. I can&#x2019;t put it any better than that.<br> <br>&#x201c;If he says one more word, I wash my hands of the whole thing,&#x201d; LeBay said, and cocked a horny, callused thumb at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t, he won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Arnie said hastily. &#x201c;Three hundred, did you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I believe that was&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two-fifty was the quoted price,&#x201d; I said loudly.<br> <br>Arnie looked stricken, afraid the old man would walk away again, but LeBay was taking no chances. The fish was almost out of the pond now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two-fifty would do it, I guess,&#x201d; LeBay allowed. He glanced my way again, and I saw that we had an understanding&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t like me and I didn&#x2019;t like him.<br> <br>To my ever-increasing horror, Arnie pulled his wallet out and began thumbing through it. There was silence among the three of us. LeBay looked on. I looked away at a little kid who was trying to kill himself on a puke-green skateboard. Somewhere a dog barked. Two girls who looked like eighth-or ninth-graders went past, giggling and holding clutches of library books to their blooming chests. I had only one hope left for getting Arnie out of this; it was the day before payday. Given time, even twenty-four hours, this wild fever might pass. Arnie was beginning to remind me of Toad, of Toad Hall.<br> <br>When I looked back, Arnie and LeBay were looking at two fives and six ones&#x2014;all that had been in his wallet, apparently.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a check?&#x201d; Arnie asked.<br> <br>LeBay offered Arnie a dry smile and said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good check,&#x201d; Arnie protested. It would be, too. We had been working all summer for Carson Brothers on the I-376 extension, the one which natives of the Pittsburgh area firmly believe will never be really finished. Arnie sometimes declared that Penn-DOT had begun taking bids on the I-376 work shortly after the Civil War ended. Not that either of us had any right to complain; a lot of kids were either working for slave wages that summer or not working at all. We were making good money, even clocking some overtime. Brad Jeffries, the job foreman, had been frankly dubious about taking a kid like Arnie on, but had finally allowed that he could use a flagman; the girl he had been planning to hire had gotten herself pregnant and had run off to get married. So Arnie had started off flagging in June but had gotten into the harder work little by little, running mostly on guts and determination. It was the first real job he&#x2019;d ever had, and he didn&#x2019;t want to screw it up. Brad was reasonably impressed, and the summer sun had even helped Arnie&#x2019;s erupting complexion a little. Maybe it was the ultraviolet.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s a good check, son,&#x201d; LeBay said, &#x201c;but I gotta make a cash deal. You understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know if Arnie understood, but I did. It would be too easy to stop payment on a local check if this rustbucket Plymouth threw a rod or blew a piston on the way home.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can call the bank,&#x201d; Arnie said, starting to sound desperate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; LeBay said, scratching his armpit above the scabrous brace. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going on five-thirty. Bank&#x2019;s long since closed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A deposit, then,&#x201d; Arnie said, and held out the sixteen dollars. He looked positively wild. It may be that you&#x2019;re having trouble believing a kid who was almost old enough to vote could have gotten himself so worked up over an anonymous old clunk in the space of fifteen minutes. I was having some trouble believing it myself. Only Roland D. LeBay seemed not to be having trouble with it, and I supposed it was because at his age he had seen everything. It was only later that I came to believe that his odd sureness might come from other sources. Either way, if any milk of human kindness had ever run in his veins, it had curdled to sour cream long ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have to have at least ten percent down,&#x201d; LeBay said. The fish was out of the water; in a moment it would be netted. &#x201c;If I had ten percent, I&#x2019;d hold her for twenty-four hours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dennis,&#x201d; Arnie said. &#x201c;Can you loan me nine bucks until tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had twelve in my own wallet, and no particular place to go. Day after day of spreading sand and digging trenches for culverts had done wonders when it came to getting ready for football practice, but I had no social life at all. Lately I hadn&#x2019;t even been assaulting the ramparts of my cheerleader girlfriend&#x2019;s body in the style to which she had become accustomed. I was rich but lonely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on over here and let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>LeBay&#x2019;s brow darkened, but he could see he was stuck with my input, like it or not. His frizzy white hair blew back and forth in the mild breeze. He kept one hand possessively on the Plymouth&#x2019;s hood.<br> <br>Arnie and I walked back toward where my car, a &#x2019;75 Duster, was parked at the curb. I put an arm around Arnie&#x2019;s shoulders. For some reason I remembered the two of us up in his room on a rainy fall day...</p><h2>Tapping the Source</h2><p>People came to Huntington Beach in search of the endless party, the ultimate high &amp; the perfect wave. Ike Tucker came to look for his sister &amp; for the men who may have murdered her. When he looked into the shadows he made some disturbing discoveries.'</p><p>If you aren't already familiar with Kem Nunn's 1984 novel <i>Tapping the Source</i>, or if the idea of a "classic surfing novel" makes you either chuckle or shudder, be prepared to realign your literary biases. This is not a story of gilded surfers and sun-bleached blonds, of insouciant days and moonlit nights on the beach; instead, Nunn has crafted a darkly pensive meditation on solitude and desire. Ike Tucker is the quintessential loner, trapped by both circumstance and inclination in a California desert town, abandoned first by his mother and then by his sister, Ellen, who fled, in turn, toward the promise of the coast. His awareness of his own alienation, rendered in prose that is always elegant and often poignant, is haunting: <blockquote>As he listened the train sounds grew faint and disappeared and someone shut off the music so there was just the silence, that special kind of silence that comes to the desert, and he knew that if he waited there would come a time, stars fading, slim band of light creeping on the horizon, when the silence would grow until it was unbearable, until it was as if the land itself were about to break it, to give up some secret of its own.</blockquote><p> The secret, though, comes not from the desert but from the sea. Propelled by a mysterious rumor of his sister's murder, Ike enters the surfing mecca of Huntington Beach, whose bright fa�ade conceals shadowy violence and joyless violation. Wistfully intent on understanding the men who might have killed his sister, Ike abandons himself to the hypnotic allure of the ocean: "The tide was low and the waves turned crisp black faces toward the shore while trails of mist rose from their feathering lips in the golden sun." Nunn's language effortlessly reflects Ike's desires and fears; the novel spirals gracefully into the young man's eventual immersion in the surfing culture and riffs on the terrifying ease with which that immersion becomes overwhelming. Although a murder may lie at the heart of the narrative, the novel is far more an exploration of character than of suspect and motive--and that exploration is infinitely rewarding. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><b>Kem Nunn</b> spent his youth in Southern California surfing and working on boats and did not go to college to study the writer's craft until he was nearly 30.

Unwilling to cut herself off from her Jewish background, she had the additional burden of attempting to bridge the gap between communities.<br><br>In <i>Amy Levy: Her Life and Letters</i> Linda Hunt Beckman examines Levy&#x2019;s writings and other cultural documents for insight into her emotional and intellectual life. This groundbreaking study introduces us to a woman well deserving of a place in literary and cultural history.</p></p><p><p><b>Linda Hunt Beckman</b> is Professor of English at Ohio University and the author of<i> A Woman&#x2019;s Portion: Ideology, Culture, and the Female Novel Tradition</i> as well as numerous articles and essays.</p>The poetry and fiction of Amy Levy (1861-89) have faded into obscurity. But in this important biography, which complements The Complete Novels and Selected Writings of Amy Levy, edited by Melvyn New and published in 1993, Beckman (English, Ohio Univ.) seeks to rectify this oversight. Born to a large, middle-class Jewish family in Victorian England, Levy spent most of her 27 years attempting to bridge the gap between the religious roots she was loath to forsake and the literary circles she sought to join. Her homosexuality guaranteed further alienation. In her fiction, most notably the novel Reuben Sachs (1888), Levy described the cultural glass ceiling Jews in England continuously faced. Sadly, most of the accolades for Levy's work came in the form of obituaries (by such luminaries as Oscar Wilde and W.B. Yeats) after her 1889 suicide. Beckman includes Levy's letters in the appendix, which serves as an excellent complement to the lucid narrative and a way to hear her long-silent voice. Highly recommended for larger literature collections.DDiane Gardner Premo, Rochester P.L., NY <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>From Here to There and Back Again</h2><p><p>"Sue Hubbell's <i>From Here to There and Back Again</i> is stylish and thought-provoking.

An avid reader, she had time to practice both reading and writing when she came down with rheumatic fever, which left her stuck in bed for months. Hermes majored in speech and English at St. John's University, and taught junior high school English and social studies before taking time off to raise her five children. Returning to teaching after a number of years, she found it less satisfying than she'd remembered, and decided to try her hand at writing for publication. She took a class in writing nonfiction for adults; the teacher, Russell Freedman, would go on to win the Newbery Medal.<br><br>After publishing some articles, Hermes found the niche she'd been looking for: her first novel for young readers, What If They Knew?, was published in 1980. Hermes gave the main character in the book epilepsy, a problem she had dealt with herself as a child. Readers responded well to the believable situation, and over the years Hermes has continued to write stories featuring youngsters in difficult situations, so that readers can turn to her books knowing they are not alone. She has written more than 20 books for children and young adults.<br><br>Patricia Hermes lives in Connecticut, where she spends four hours of the day writing and the rest editing her work and answering letters.

In this, her second diary, she describes her family's struggle to survive during the winter. Food is scarce and the settlers are wary of venturing outside the fort for fear of being attacked by Indians. Things become more desperate when sickness sweeps through the fort. In a last-ditch effort to save her family, Elizabeth ventures out to seek help from her friend Pocahontas in a nearby Indian village. The historical detailsare woven so intricately into the plot that they become an integral part of the story. While there is not much action, the sense of difficulty and harshness the settlers faced is apparent. Elizabeth is a mature and responsible figure who seems to act beyond her years. A "Historical Note" describes the situation at the real Jamestwon settlement and shows black-and-white drawings of the fort and its inhabitants.<br>---School Library Journal, June 2001</p><h2>Wrinkle in Time, A</h2><p>A Wrinkle In Time by MACMILLAN / MPS</p><p>Everyone in town thinks Meg is volatile and dull-witted and that her younger brother Charles Wallace is dumb.

But the origins of this beloved sport and the charismatic athletes who helped it achieve prominence in the mid-twentieth century have been largely forgotten, until now.<br> <br><i>Fastpitch</i> brings to life the eclectic mix of characters that make up softball&#x2019;s vibrant 129-year history. From its humble beginnings in 1887, when it was invented in a Chicago boat club and played with a broomstick, to the rise in the 1940s and 1950s of professional-caliber company-sponsored teams that toured the country in style, softball&#x2019;s history is as diverse as it is fascinating. Though it&#x2019;s thought of today as a woman&#x2019;s sport, fastpitch softball&#x2019;s early years featured several male stars, such as the vaudeville-esque Eddie Feigner, whose signature move was striking out batters while blindfolded.<br> <br>But because softball was one of the only team sports that women were allowed to play competitively, it took on added importance for female athletes. Top fastpitch teams of the 1940s, &#x2018;50s, and &#x2018;60s, such as the New Orleans Jax Maids and Connecticut&#x2019;s Raybestos Brakettes, gave women access to employment and travel opportunities that would have been unavailable to them otherwise. At a time when female athletes had almost no prospects, softball offered them a chance to flourish. Women put off marriage and moved across the country just for a shot at joining a strong team.<br> <br>Told from the perspective of such influential players as Bertha Ragan Tickey, who set strikeout records and taught Lana Turner to pitch, and Joan Joyce, who struck out baseball legend Ted Williams and helped found a professional softball league with Billie Jean King, <i>Fastpitch </i>chronicles softball&#x2019;s rich history and its uncertain future (as evidenced by its controversial elimination from the 2012 Olympics and the mounting efforts to have it reinstated).

This was the summer when violence against blacks increased at an alarming rate and when the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi resulted in national media attention. Charles Marsh takes us back to this place and time, when the lives of activists on all sides of the civil rights issue converged and their images of God clashed. He weaves their voices into a gripping narrative: a Ku Klux Klansman, for example, borrows fiery language from the Bible to link attacks on blacks to his "priestly calling"; a middle-aged woman describes how the Gospel inspired her to rally other African Americans to fight peacefully for their dignity; a SNCC worker tells of harrowing encounters with angry white mobs and his pilgrimage toward a new racial spirituality called Black Power. Through these emotionally charged stories, Marsh invites us to consider the civil rights movement anew, in terms of religion as a powerful yet protean force driving social action.</p><br><p>The book's central figures are Fannie Lou Hamer, who "worked for Jesus" in civil rights activism; Sam Bowers, the Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi; William Douglas Hudgins, an influential white Baptist pastor and unofficial theologian of the "closed society"; Ed King, a white Methodist minister and Mississippi native who campaigned to integrate Protestant congregations; and Cleveland Sellers, a SNCC staff member turned black militant.</p><br><p>Marsh focuses on the events and religious convictions that led each person into the political upheaval of 1964. He presents an unforgettable American social landscape, one that is by turns shameful and inspiring. In conclusion, Marsh suggests that it may be possible to sift among these narratives and lay the groundwork for a new thinking about racial reconciliation and the beloved community. He maintains that the person who embraces faith's life-affirming energies will leave behind a most powerful legacy of social activism and compassion.</p></p><p>Charles Marsh thinks historians who argue the civil rights movement was about rights have made a big mistake. In <i>God's Long Summer: Stories of Faith and Civil Rights</i>, he takes a different stance. He says the civil rights movement was about God. Marsh defends this controversial thesis with five profiles of civil rights leaders (ranging from cotton fieldworker and political activist Fannie Lou Hamer to the Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi, Sam Bowers), each of whom understood their work in fundamentally theological terms. Marsh's fluid, engaging prose aims to persuade readers that the ongoing fight for civil rights is best understood in spiritual terms and to arm believers with a clear understanding of the ultimate stakes of this country's continuing struggle with racism. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>"Marsh celebrates the importance of Christian faith in founding the civil rights movement, [exploring] as well the devastating dichotomy of hate and prejudice."--<b>Andrew Young</b></p> <p>"Mississippi Freedom Summer tested my commitment and my faith.... To this day, I wonder how those who opposed us reconciled their faith with their hatred and their anger or even their inaction. [Marsh] admirably attempts to explore this unfathomable paradox."--<b>John Lewis, Member of Congress, 5th District, Georgia</b></p> <p>"This wonderfully narrated book offers truths about the civil rights struggle of the 1960s often overlooked-the intensely moral and spiritual side of an effort that had an enormous impact on our secular life."--<b>Robert Coles</b></p></p><h2>Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman&#39;s Soul</h2><p>Every little girl has dreams of being swept up into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess. Sadly, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with duty and demands. Many Christian women are tired, struggling under the weight of the pressure to be a "good servant," a nurturing caregiver, or a capable home manager.<p>What Wild at Heart did for men, Captivating is doing for women. Setting their hearts free. This groundbreaking book shows readers the glorious design of women before the fall, describes how the feminine heart can be restored, and casts a vision for the power, freedom, and beauty of a woman released to be all she was meant to be. By revealing the core desires every woman shares-to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty-John and Stasi Eldredge invite women to recover their feminine hearts, created in the image of an intimate and passionate God. Further, they encourage men to discover the secret of a woman's soul and to delight in the beauty and strength women were created to offer.</p></p><p><b>John Eldredge</b> is the founder and director of Ransomed Heart&#x2122; Ministries in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a fellowship devoted to helping people discover the heart of God. John is the author of numerous books, including <i>Epic, Waking the Dead, Wild at Heart, and Desire</i>, and coauthor of Captivating and The Sacred Romance. John lives in Colorado with his wife, Stasi, and their three sons, Samuel, Blaine, and Luke. He loves living in the Rocky Mountains so he can pursue his other passions, including fly-fishing, mountain climbing, and exploring the waters of the West in his canoe.<p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p> <p>Now we are on holy ground. Writing a book for men (<em>Wild at Heart</em>) was a fairly straightforward proposition. Not that men are simpletons. But they <em>are</em> the less complicated of the two genders trying to navigate love and life together. Both men and women know this to be true. The mystery of the feminine heart was meant to be a good thing, by the way. A source of joy. Yet it has become a source of shame--women almost universally feel that they are "too much" and "not what they should be." And men tend to pull away from the deeper waters of a woman's soul, unsure of what they will find there or how to handle it. And so we have missed the treasure that is the heart of a woman, missed the richness femininity was meant to bring to our lives, missed the way it speaks to us of the heart of God. </p> <p>Rest assured--this is not a book about all the things you are failing to do as a woman. We're tired of those books. As a new Christian, the first book I (Stasi) picked up to read on godly femininity I threw across the room. I never picked it up again. In the twenty-five years since, I have only read a few I could wholeheartedly recommend. The rest drive me crazy. Their messages to women make me feel as though, "You are not the woman you ought to be--but if you do the following ten things, you can make the grade." They are, by and large, soul-killing. But femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula.</p> <p> We have women friends who love tea parties and china, and friends who break out in hives at the thought of them. We have women friends who love to hunt, bow hunt even. Women who love to entertain and women who don't. Women who are professors, moms, doctors, nurses, missionaries, dentists, homemakers, therapists, chefs, artists, poets, rock climbers, triathletes, secretaries, salespeople, and social workers. Beautiful women, all. </p> <p>So--is a true woman Cinderella or Joan of Arc? Mary Magdalene or Oprah? How do we recover essential femininity without falling into stereotypes, or worse, ushering in more pressure and shame upon our readers? That is the last thing a woman needs. And yet, there <em>is</em> an essence that God has given to every woman. We share something deep and true, down in our hearts. So we venture into this exploration of femininity by way of the <em>heart</em>. What is at the core of a woman's heart? What are her desires? What did we long for as little girls? What do we still long for as women? And, how does a woman begin to be healed from the wounds and tragedies of her life? </p> <p>Sometime between the dreams of your youth and yesterday, something precious has been lost. And that treasure is your heart, your priceless feminine heart. God has set within you a femininity that is powerful and tender, fierce and alluring. No doubt it has been misunderstood. Surely it has been assaulted. But it is there, your true heart, and it is worth recovering. You <em>are</em> captivating. </p> <p>So we invite you to take a journey with us, a journey of discovery and healing. For your heart is the prize of God's Kingdom, and Jesus has come to win you back for himself--all of you. To help your journey, we've written <em>Captivating: A Guided Journal</em>. You might want to use it as you read this book. And, gather a group of women and go through it together! We pray that God will use this book in your life, in your heart, to bring healing, restoration, joy, and life! And if God does that, it will be cause for a wonderful celebration. With teacups and china. Or paper plates. Whatever. One day, we will all celebrate together. In anticipation and hope, may this little book draw you closer to God's heart--and your own.</p></p><h2>HALO: The Thursday War</h2><p><p><b>The second book of the <i>Glasslands </i>trilogy, another action packed adventure in the vast universe of the Halo game where the Human-Covenant War rages on. </b></p><p>Welcome to humanity's new war: silent, high stakes, and unseen.

Joined by his best friend, Dillon Wallace, and a Scots-Cree guide, George Elson, Hubbard hoped to make a name for himself as an adventurer. But plagued by poor judgment and bad luck, his party turned back and Hubbard died of starvation just thirty miles from camp. Two years later, Hubbard&#39;s widow, Mina, and Wallace returned to Labrador, leading rival expeditions to complete the original trek and fix blame for the earlier failure. Their race made headlines from New York to Nova Scotia-and it makes fascinating reading today in this widely acclaimed reconstruction of the epic saga. The authors draw on contemporary accounts and their own journeys in Labrador to evoke the intense drama to men and women pushed beyond the limits of endurance in one of the great true adventures of our century.</p><p>In 1903 Leonidas Hubbard set out to cross the Ungava-Labrador Peninsula, and to forge a name for himself as an adventure writer. He took a friend, a guide, a canoe, a ton of equipment, and scads of naive hope. Months later, the friend and guide staggered out of the snow, and Hubbard starved to death in his tent, too weak to attempt the 30-mile trek to safety. And that&#39;s just Part I.

Koop is his &#34;own man,&#34; answering only to his inner voice and religious convictions. Although narrated by Christopher Hurt in a reedy, flat reading, the presentation is thoroughly believable, lending an authentic touch and feeling that it is &#34;Koop.&#34; Though occasionally marred by background noise, the sound quality is good. R.H.M. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine``Keep your head down and your mouth shut'' was advice given to the would-be Surgeon General early in his Washington days; fortunately, the high-profile and controversial Koop chose otherwise, both in his career and in these lively memoirs. The ``health conscience of America'' is how Koop says he'd like to be remembered--and he is that and much more: an innovative pediatric surgeon whose skills have altered thousands of lives, a man of scientific integrity whose tenure as Surgeon General alternately delighted and confounded both the right and the left, a Bible-reading evangelical Christian with a mission, and a bloody but unbowed veteran of eight years of Washington bureaucracy. His account of his early years, though pleasant enough, is unremarkable, but his writing moves into high gear when he talks about his years as a pediatric surgeon and the painful and prolonged process of becoming confirmed as Surgeon General. Koop recounts his battles with the powerful tobacco industry; his efforts to prod the Reagan Administration to take action in the war on AIDS and his subsequent attacks from the religious right on this same issue; his stand on the Baby Doe case and the rights of handicapped children; and, as expected, his opposition to abortion. Koop concludes with brief essays on what he considers major health issues of the day, such as health insurance, preventive health care, problems of aging, nutrition and food safety, drugs and alcohol, and domestic violence: Clearly much remains on his agenda. Good stories and honest opinions from an American original, who, though now stripped of his colorful vice admiral's uniform, is not about to fade away.

The Italian national dish is beloved everywhere in the United States, yet no comprehensive book has ever been published in English on the innumerable ways Italians sauce and service it - until now! A huge variety of spaghettis noodles, macaronis, shells, bows, lasagna, etc., is as available in our markets as it is in Italy. Most Americans are also familiar with a least three or four famous pasta sauces. But there are in fact hundreds of delicious ways to serve pasta 0- and over 500 of them are given in this book. Fully two-thirds of these recipes are for conveniently quick and easy dishes, for simplicity is a virtue of Italian cooking in general and of pasta cookery in particular. Most of the authentic ingredients of sauces for pasta - the vegetables, seafoods, herbs, cheeses, meats, fine olive oil - are as available as the pastas themselves. There are also imposingly elaborate pasta dishes, however, great regional classics to challenge the skill of experts. Pasta cookery is an astonishingly varied subject. Not only is there an uncounted number of sizes and shapes of pastas (over 100 of those found in this country are described in the illustrated glossary). But also, all of the style, tradition, regional flavors, ingredients, techniques of Italian cooking must at least be touched upon to write a complete book of pasta. One must in effect write a major Italian cookbook - which is what Jack Denton Scott has done.</p><p></p><h2>A Field Guide to Birds of the West Indies, 5th Edition (Peterson Field Guides)</h2><p>From Grand Bahama Island in the north to Grenada in the south, this guide covers a tropical avifaunal region which includes such species as the tiny bee hummingbird, parrots, honey-creepers and todies.

She now directs Trinity University Press in San Antonio, Texas.</p>Ras's first collection, winner of the 1997 Walt Whitman Award, selected by C.K. Williams, explores what constitutes a sense of family today. These readable autobiographical scrapbook-collages, showing how woman's experience bears a multigenerational identity, are about pregnancy, giving birth, childhood and raising children, adulthood, ethnic (Polish) grandparents, home and work, "the gross margin/ of greed, desire billowing like a tall ship," and what it means "to spend a lifetime together." With a long-lined, striding quality, as though hiking through "whole vistas" of time, abundant and ruminative sequences of precise details ("even the saddest ones") weave together "every sorrow" of aging and "the way/ children are given to dreams." Ras transforms what might appear to be clutter with a wide-angle focus on images that depict how ordinary personal memories grow into a beautiful "life of the mind" that transcends selfhood. Reading these spacious poems, one concludes with Ras, that despite "the sadness" of memory, one "can have love,/ though often it will be mysterious."

For years, Harry Dresden has been Chicago&#39;s only professional wizard, but a bargain made in desperation with the Queen of Air and Darkness has forced him into a new job: professional killer. Mab, the mother of wicked faeries, has restored the mostly-dead wizard to health, and dispatches him upon his first mission - to bring death to an immortal. Even as he grapples with the impossible task, Dresden learns of a looming danger to Demonreach, the living island hidden upon Lake Michigan, a place whose true purpose and dark potential have the potential to destroy billions and to land Dresden in the deepest trouble he has ever known - even deeper than being dead. How messed up is that? Beset by his new enemies and hounded by the old, Dresden has only twenty four hours to reconnect with his old allies, prevent a cataclysm and do the impossible - all while the power he bargained to get - but never meant to keep - lays siege to his very soul. Magic. It can get a guy killed.</p><p>Jim Butcher is a bestselling author and martial arts enthusiast.

But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that just doesn&#x2019;t convey how soft this bed was. You know those old cartoons where people sleep on fluffy clouds? Those guys would wake up screaming in pain if they got suckered into taking one of those clouds after they&#x2019;d been in Mab&#x2019;s bed.</p><p>The fire in my chest had finally begun to die away. The heavy wool lining coating my thoughts seemed to have lightened up. When I blinked my eyes open, they felt gummy, but I was able to lift my arm, slowly, and wipe them clear. I&#x2019;d gone jogging on beaches with less sand than was in my eyes.</p><p>Man. Being mostly dead is hard on a guy.</p><p>I was in a bed.</p><p>A bed the size of my old apartment.</p><p>The sheets were all perfectly white and smooth. The bed was shrouded in drapes of more pure white, drifting on gentle currents of cool air. The temperature was cold enough that when I exhaled, my breath condensed, but I was comfortable beneath the bed&#x2019;s covering.</p><p>The curtains around the bed parted and a girl appeared.</p><p>She was probably too young to drink legally and she was one of the lovelier women I&#x2019;d ever seen in person. High cheekbones, exotic almond-shaped eyes. Her skin was a medium olive tone, her eyes an almost eerie shade of pale green-gold. Her hair was pulled back into a simple tail, she wore pale blue hospital scrubs, and she had no makeup at all.</p><p>Wow. Any woman who could wear that and still look that good was a freaking goddess.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said, and smiled at me. Maybe it was just the bed talking, but the smile and her voice were even better than the rest of her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said. My voice came out in a croak that hardly sounded human. I started coughing.</p><p>She placed a covered tray on a little stand beside the bed and sat down on the edge of it. She took the cover off the tray and picked up a white china cup. She passed it to me, and it proved to be filled with not quite scalding chicken noodle soup. &#x201c;You do that every day. Talk before you&#x2019;ve gotten anything down your throat. Drink.&#x201d;</p><p>I did. Campbell&#x2019;s. And it was awesome. I flashed on a sudden memory of being sick when I was very young. I couldn&#x2019;t remember where we&#x2019;d been, but my dad had made me chicken noodle soup. It was the same.</p><p>&#x201c;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I remember some of it,&#x201d; I said, after several sips. &#x201c;Your name is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sarah?&#x201d; She frowned, but I shook my head before she could speak. &#x201c;No, wait. Sarissa. Your name is Sarissa.&#x201d;</p><p>She lifted both eyebrows and smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a first. It looks like you&#x2019;re finally coming back into focus.&#x201d;</p><p>My stomach gurgled and at the same time a roaring hunger went through me. I blinked at the sudden sensation and started gurgling down more soup.</p><p>Sarissa laughed at me. It made the room feel brighter. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drown yourself. There&#x2019;s no rush.&#x201d;</p><p>I finished the cup, spilling only a little on my chin, and then murmured, &#x201c;The hell there isn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m starving. What else is there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Before you do that, let&#x2019;s shoot for another first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eh?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you tell me your name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What, you don&#x2019;t know?&#x201d;</p><p>Sarissa smiled again. &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Harry Dresden,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Her eyes sparkled and it made me feel good all the way to my toes. More so when she produced a plate that was piled with chicken and mashed potatoes and some other vegetables that I had little use for but which were probably good for me. I thought I was going to start drooling onto the floor, that food looked so good.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you do, Harry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Professional wizard,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a PI in Chicago.&#x201d; I frowned, suddenly remembering something else. &#x201c;Oh. And I&#x2019;m the Winter Knight, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>She stared at me like a statue for several seconds, absolutely nothing on her face.</p><p>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Food?&#x201d;</p><p>She shivered and looked away from me. Then she took a quick breath and picked up an odd little fork, the kind they give to kids with motor control issues&#x2014;it had lots of rounded edges&#x2014;and pressed it into my hand. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re willing to go for three, we&#x2019;ll have had a really good day.&#x201d;</p><p>The fork felt weird and heavy in my fingers. I remembered using forks. I remembered how they felt, the slender weight of them, the precision with which I could get food from the plate to my mouth. This fork felt heavy and clumsy. I fumbled with it for a few seconds, and then managed, on the second try, to thrust it into the mashed potatoes. Then it was another chore to get the stupid thing to my mouth.</p><p>The potatoes were perfect. Just warm enough, barely salted, with a faint hint of rich butter.</p><p>&#x201c;Ohmmgdd,&#x201d; I muttered around the mouthful. Then I went for more.</p><p>The second forkful was easier, and the third easier than that, and before I knew it the plate was empty and I was scraping the last of the remains into my mouth. I felt exhausted and stuffed, though it hadn&#x2019;t been all that much food. Sarissa was watching me with a pleased smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Got it all over my face, don&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; I asked her.</p><p>&#x201c;It means you enjoyed the food,&#x201d; she said. She lifted a napkin to my face and wiped at it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to know your name, finally, Harry.&#x201d;</p><p>There was the sound of light, steady footsteps coming closer.</p><p>Sarissa rose immediately, turned, and then knelt gracefully on the floor with her head bowed.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; said a woman&#x2019;s velvet voice.</p><p>My whole body shuddered in response to that voice, like a guitar&#x2019;s string quivering when the proper note is played near it.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s lucid, Your Majesty, and remembered my name and his. He fed himself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excellent,&#x201d; said the voice. &#x201c;You are dismissed for today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Your Majesty,&#x201d; said Sarissa. She rose, glanced at me, and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to see you feeling better, Sir Knight.&#x201d;</p><p>I tried to come up with something charming or witty and said, &#x201c;Call me.&#x201d;</p><p>She huffed out a surprised little breath that might have been the beginning of a laugh, but shot a fearful glance the other way and then retreated. The sound of her sneakers scuffing on the hard floor faded into the distance outside the curtained bed.</p><p>A shadow moved across the curtains at the end of the bed. I knew whose it was.</p><p>&#x201c;You have passed your nadir,&#x201d; she said in a decidedly pleased tone. &#x201c;You are waxing rather than waning, my Knight.&#x201d;</p><p>I suddenly had difficulty thinking clearly enough to speak, but I managed. &#x201c;Well. You know. Wax on, wax off.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t open the curtain around the bed as much as she simply glided through, letting the sheer cloth press against her, outlining her form. She exhaled slowly as she reached my side, looking down at me, her eyes flickering through shades of green in dizzying cycles.</p><p>Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness, was too terrifying to be beautiful. Though every cell in my body suddenly surged with mindless desire and my eyes blurred with tears to see her beauty, I did not want to come an inch closer. She was a tall woman, well over six feet, and every inch was radiance. Pale skin, soft lips the color of frozen raspberries, long silver-white hair that shone with opalescent highlights. She was dressed in a silk gown of deep frozen green that left her strong white shoulders bare.</p><p>And she was about six inches away from being in bed with me.</p><p>&#x201c;You look great,&#x201d; I croaked.</p><p>Something smoldered in those almond-shaped eyes. &#x201c;I <i>am</i> great, my Knight,&#x201d; she murmured. She reached out a hand, and her nails were all dark blues and greens, the colors shimmering and changing like deep opals. She touched my naked shoulder with those nails.</p><p>And I suddenly felt like a fifteen-year-old about to kiss a girl for the first time&#x2014;excitement and wild expectation and fluttering anxiety.</p><p>Her nails, even just the very tips, were icy cold. She trailed them down over one side of my chest and rested them over my heart.</p><p>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; I said into what was, for me, an incredibly awkward silence. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;</p><p>She tilted her head and stared at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Sarissa seems nice,&#x201d; I ventured.</p><p>&#x201c;A changeling,&#x201d; Mab said. &#x201c;Who once sought of me a favor. She saw Lloyd Slate&#x2019;s tenure as my Knight.&#x201d;</p><p>I licked my lips. &#x201c;Um. Where are we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Arctis Tor,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My stronghold. In the Knight&#x2019;s suite. You will find every mortal amenity here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What with my apartment burned to the ground and all. Is there a security deposit?&#x201d;</p><p>A slow smile oozed over Mab&#x2019;s mouth and she leaned even closer to me. &#x201c;It is well that you heal,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Your spirit wandered far from your body while you slept.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Free spirit,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not anymore,&#x201d; Mab murmured, and leaned down toward me. &#x201c;You are shaking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes filled my vision. &#x201c;Are you frightened of me, Harry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sane,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think I am going to hurt you?&#x201d; she breathed, her lips a fraction of an inch from mine.</p><p>My heart beat so hard that it actually hurt. &#x201c;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are who you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Surely you have no reason to fear,&#x201d; she whispered, her breath tickling my lips. &#x201c;You are mine now. If you are not well, I cannot use you to work my will.&#x201d;</p><p>I tried to force myself to relax. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t seen her picking up the thick, fluffy pillow beside me while she held my eyes. So I was totally unprepared when she struck, as fast as any snake, and slammed the pillow down over my face.</p><p>I froze for half a second, and the pillow pressed down harder, shutting off my air, clogging my nose and mouth. Then the fear took over. I struggled, but my arms and legs felt as if they&#x2019;d been coated in inches of lead. I tried to push Mab away, but she was simply too heavy, my arms too weak. Her hands and forearms were frozen steel, slender and immovable.</p><p>My vision went from red to black. Sensation began to recede.</p><p>Mab was cool. Unrelenting. Merciless.</p><p>She was Mab.</p><p>If I did not stop her, she <i>would</i> kill me. Mab couldn&#x2019;t kill a mortal, but to her I was no longer one of them. I was her vassal, a member of her court, and as far as she was concerned, she had every right to take my life if she saw fit.</p><p>That cold knowledge galvanized me. I locked my hands around one of her arms and twisted, straining my entire body. My hips arched up off the bed with the effort, and I wasn&#x2019;t even trying to push her away. There was no opposing the absolute force of her. But I did manage to direct her strength just a little to one side, and in so doing managed to push her hands and the smothering pillow past me, freeing my face enough to suck in a gasp of sweet, cold air.</p><p>Mab lay with her upper body across mine, and made no effort at all to move. I could feel her eyes on me, feel the empty intensity of her gaze as I panted, my head swimming with the sudden rush of blessed oxygen.</p><p>Mab moved very slowly, very gracefully. There was something serpentine about the way she slithered up my body and lay with her chest against mine. She was a cold, ephemeral weight, an incredibly feminine softness, and her silken hair glided over my cheeks and lips and neck.</p><p>Mab made a low, hungry sound in her throat as she leaned down, until her lips were almost touching my ear.</p><p>&#x201c;I have no use for weakness, wizard.&#x201d; She shivered in a kind of slow, alien ecstasy. &#x201c;Rest. Heal. Sleep. I shall most likely kill you on the morrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You? A <i>Princess Bride</i> quote?&#x201d; I croaked.</p><p>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Then she was gone. Just <i>gone</i>.</p><p>And that was day one of my physical therapy.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I could describe the next few weeks in detail, but as bad as they were, they did have a certain routine to them. Besides, in my head, they&#x2019;re a music video montage set to the Foo Fighters&#x2019; &#x201c;Walk.&#x201d;</p><p>I would wake in the morning and find Sarissa waiting for me, keeping a polite and professional distance between us. She would help me take care of the needs of my weakened body, which was rarely dignified, but she never spoke about herself. At some point after that, Mab would try to kill me in increasingly unexpected and inventive ways.</p><p>In the video in my head, there&#x2019;s a shot of me eating my own meal again&#x2014;until, just as I finish, the giant bed bursts into flames. I awkwardly flop out of it and crawl away before I roast. Then, obviously the next day, Sarissa is helping me walk to the bathroom and back. Just as I relax back into bed, a poisonous serpent, a freaking Indian cobra, falls from the bed&#x2019;s canopy onto my shoulders. I scream like a girl and throw it on the floor. The next day, I&#x2019;m fumbling my way into new clothes with Sarissa&#x2019;s help&#x2014;until a small swarm of stinging ants comes boiling out of them onto my flesh, and I have to literally rip the clothes off of me.</p><p>It goes on like that. Sarissa and me on waist-high parallel bars, me struggling to remember how to keep my balance, interrupted by a tidal flood of red-eyed rats that forces us to hop up onto the bars before our feet get eaten off. Sarissa spotting me on a bench press, and then Mab bringing a great big old fireman&#x2019;s ax whistling down at my head at the end of my third set so that I have to block with the stupid straight bar. Me slogging my exhausted way into a hot shower, only to have the door slam shut and the thing start to fill with water. Into which freaking piranha begin to plop.</p><p>On and on. Seventy-seven days. Seventy-seven attempted murders. Use your imagination. Mab sure as hell did. There was even a ticking crocodile.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I had just gotten back from the small gym, where&#x2019;d I&#x2019;d hiked a...</p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: Weather</h2><p><p>From whirling tornadoes to freezing blizzards, weather is a constantly changing force that affects everything around us.

"The imaginative use of photographs helps to clarify many of the concepts."<i>School Library Journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Grade 5-8-- These series' entries feature attractive spreads filled with eye-catching illustrative materials and clear, concise writing. Invention surveys major areas of technology throughout history, with each spread showing the stages of development in one field (e.g., timekeeping, metalworking). Most captions include the approximate date of the invention pictured, but some years are not given, making it occasionally difficult to trace how each new step evolved. In Weather , the imaginative use of photographs helps to clarify many of the concepts. Reptile stands out because of the fascinating photographs, which are brilliantly lifelike and well chosen to demonstrate concepts discussed, educating readers in a way that words (or mediocre illustrations) cannot. The text is nicely balanced between straightforward factual data and intriguing bits of trivia, making the book useful both to browsers and report writers. Both gems and crystals are noted briefly in Symes's Rocks &amp; Minerals (Knopf, 1988) from this series, but receive more expansive treatment (and all-new photographs) in the newer title.

And what if a young clairvoyant named Amanda reestablishes the flea circus as popular entertainment and fertility worship as the principal religious form of our high-tech age? <b>Another Roadside Attraction</b> answers those questions and a lot more. It tell us, for example, what the sixties were truly all about, not by reporting on the psychedelic decade but by recreating it, from the inside out. In the process, this stunningly original seriocomic thriller is fully capable of simultaneously eating a literary hot dog and eroding the borders of the mind.</p><p>It's clear that when Robbins sits down to write, he has one thing on his mind: having himself some fun. I read <b>Another Roadside Attraction,</b> years ago, then immediately went back to the beginning of the book and read it again. Robbins holds nothing back in this, his first novel.

Again. <br> <br> <i>What was I thinking when I let Treir talk me into hiring him?</i> The honest answer, of course, was that he <i>wasn't</i> thinking, at least not with his brain, but rather the appendages on either side of it. It was difficult to be reasonable or to think things through when you were talking with a two-meter-tall Orion woman bred for sex appeal and wearing one of the skimpy outfits that Quark himself insisted his dabo girls wear. <br> <br>Not to be confused with the sleeveless V-neck tunic and tight shorts that his dabo <i>boy</i> was clad in as he handed over a considerable pile of winnings to a Boslic woman. It was, in fact, the third time the woman had won, and if she kept up at this rate, Quark would be bankrupt. <br> <br>With a brief hand signal to Frool to keep an eye on the bar, Quark navigated among the tables, which were fairly crowded. Three Starfleet ships were in dock at Deep Space 9 -- one about to head into the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant, one on its way to deliver supplies to the ongoing Cardassian relief effort, and one simply stopping over for shore leave after a patrol of the sector -- so the bar was full to bursting with gray-and-black-uniformed personnel, along with the usual collection of traders, cargo carriers, and travelers of all kinds that paraded through DS9 every day. Plus, of course, the regulars. <br> <br>If Quark had his way, there'd be fewer Starfleet; they weren't the biggest spenders in the galaxy, and they didn't imbibe nearly enough to suit him. There wasn't a lot he missed about the days when the Cardassians ran the station, but one was that you could always count on members of the Cardassian military to be heavy drinkers. <br> <br>Still, it was a decent day for business. <i>So I'm not about to let that Bajoran simian ruin it by giving all my latinum to that Boslic!</i> <br> <br>As he drew closer, he noticed that the Boslic woman wasn't looking at the winnings that were piling up next to her arms, which were folded neatly at the edge of the dabo table. She wasn't looking at the other players -- a Lurian freighter captain, a human Starfleet officer, and a Tellarite civilian -- who <i>were</i> looking at her winnings, and rather dolefully at that. <br> <br>She was looking at Hetik. More to the point, she was <i>staring</i> at Hetik. <br> <br>Quark knew that stare very well. It was one that was all too often etched on his own face whenever Ro Laren was in the room. Or Kira Nerys. Or Natima Lang. Or Treir. Or Ezri Dax. Or pretty much any other beautiful woman. <br> <br>In a gentle voice that sounded like honey over <i>hasperat,</i> Hetik told the Boslic woman to put all her winnings on double down. <br> <br>Without even hesitating, she did so, barely looking at the latinum strips she moved across the table. <br> <br>Quark, who knew his dabo table, relaxed and stopped in his tracks. <br> <br>The human and the Lurian both bet triple under, and the Tellarite, spitting and cursing to a degree that irritated Quark -- not so much the cursing as the spitting on the table, which he made a mental note to tell Broik to polish later -- put what little money he had remaining on double down as well. <br> <br>To Quark's lack of surprise, triple under won, and both the Tellarite and the Boslic were cleaned out. The Tellarite immediately got up and stormed out, which suited Quark fine, as he had bought only one drink, finished it hours ago, and refused every offer of a fresh one. <br> <br>However, the Boslic woman simply stood up, ran a hand over Hetik's cheek, said, "Thank you for a divine evening," and slowly exited, making sure to give Hetik several backward glances as she departed. <br> <br> <i>Okay, so maybe a dabo boy wasn't such a bad idea.</i> <br> <br>Quark worked his way back to the bar. On the way, he was intercepted by Treir. The Orion woman towered over him and favored him with a seductive smile. "You didn't trust Hetik, did you?" <br> <br>"I just wanted to keep an ear on things." Quark spoke defensively, which caused him to wonder why he felt so defensive. "Rule of Acquisition Number One-Ninety: 'Hear all, trust nothing.'" <br> <br>As they got to the bar, Quark took his place behind it. Treir draped herself over the bar so that she was at eye level with the much shorter Quark, and also gave him a very good look at her very generous cleavage, most of which was visible in her very skimpy outfit. Quark knew she did it on purpose, since she was as aware of the Fifty-Third Rule as he was -- "Never trust anybody taller than you" -- and also knew the deleterious effect her cleavage had on his higher brain functions. <br> <br>"You know," she said in her sultriest voice, "you never gave me proper compensation." <br> <br>"For what?" <br> <br>"Hiring Hetik. You didn't think hiring a dabo boy would be a good idea, but he's drawn in a huge number of customers. I think I deserve some kind of reward for that." <br> <br>Two Bajorans departed; Quark grabbed their empty glasses and put them on the shelf to be cleaned. "It's true, he has added bodies to the dabo table." <br> <br>"And yet, you haven't -- " <br> <br>" -- given you compensation? No, I haven't." Quark leaned forward on the bar, his large nose close to Treir's small green one. "You had that idea while in <i>my</i> employ to service <i>my</i> bar. 'You pay for it, it's your idea' -- Rule of Acquisition Number Twenty-Five. Since I paid for it, it's <i>my</i> brilliant idea, and I don't owe you anything." <br> <br>Treir stood up straight and looked down that small nose at Quark. This put her torso at eye level, which didn't bother Quark all that much. Treir had a magnificent torso, and the outfit she wore today left it entirely exposed, from the bottom of her breasts to the middle of her pelvis. She folded her arms over her chest. "You know, Quark, when you sold me on this job, it was as an <i>improvement</i> over being a slave." <br> <br>Quark spread his arms. "Isn't it? You don't have to have sex on demand with whomever your Orion master says you have to. You're free to come and go as you please, and you actually earn a wage. Now, if that state of affairs is no longer to your liking, you can walk out that door and that will be that -- aside from the breach-of-employment fine, of course." <br> <br>Treir smiled sweetly. "Of course." The smile fell. "You do realize that if I leave, the dabo tables will empty out in an instant." <br> <br>"Nonsense. I'll still have Hetik and M'Pella." <br> <br>"Oh, don't be so sure of that." <br> <br>Quark felt a tingle in his lobes. He couldn't help it; he <i>loved</i> it when Treir pretended she had some kind of authority over the bar. She didn't, of course, but that didn't even slow her down. And, it was true, she had made several good suggestions for improving business. <br> <br> <i>She's so invigorating.</i> <br> <br>Brushing a hand across his lobe, he started to speak, when a customer in a Starfleet uniform called out for two synthales. <br> <br>As he went over to the replicator, he said, "Anyhow, I can't afford to trust Hetik or you or anyone else. These are dangerous times." To the computer he said, "Two synthales." <br> <br>Treir scrunched her face up in confusion. "What're you talking about? Profits are up, and have been since Bajor joined the Federation." <br> <br>He handed the synthales to the officer and his companion, also in uniform. They raised their glasses in salute and drank. Quark turned back to Treir. "No, <i>revenues</i> are up. Profits are barely holding steady." <br> <br>"That doesn't make any sense. You've got people pouring in here, you gave us all a pay cut, and the dabo tables and holosuites are packed." <br> <br>"Which reminds me, shouldn't you be at your table?" <br> <br>"I'm on a break." <br> <br>Quark sighed. Instituting breaks was the biggest mistake he'd ever made. <br> <br>Treir continued. "Look at those two." She pointed at the officers to whom he'd just given the synthales. "They can get those same two synthales for free in the replimat or in their quarters, but they're willing to come here to pay for it because they like the atmosphere. Let's face it -- Quark's is the hot spot of the Bajoran sector, and everyone knows it." <br> <br>Bowing his head, Quark said, "Thank you for that lovely demonstration of the Thirty-Third Rule, but -- " <br> <br>"I'm not sucking up, Quark. I gave that up when you and Ro took me off Malic's ship. I'm telling the truth." <br> <br>That brought Quark up short. Telling the truth went counter to every instinct he had. "You see, you've just perfectly demonstrated the source of my problems." <br> <br>"I don't understand." <br> <br>"Of course not, you're a female. And -- " <br> <br>Treir pointed at Quark, which was disappointing on two fronts. For one thing, it was a fairly menacing gesture from a two-meter-tall Orion; and it meant she unfolded her arms, thus reducing the drool value of her cleavage. "So help me, Quark, if you quote the Ninety-Fourth Rule at me, I'll rip your ears off." <br> <br>Quark refused to be intimidated or aroused, though it was a close call. "Well, it's true! Females and finances <i>don't</i> mix, no matter what my mother <i>or</i> my brother says." He shook his head. " <i>Yes,</i> we've got more customers and we've got more revenues. But the only reason we're able to stay in business on this Federation station with their" -- he shuddered at the very thought -- "moneyless economy is because dear old Grand Nagus Rom decided to make my bar the Ferengi embassy to Bajor." <br> <br>The sweet smile came back. So did the folded arms, which made up for it. "I know all this, Quark. The bar's Ferengi soil, so you can -- " <br> <br>"Pay taxes." <br> <br>Treir frowned. "Huh?" <br> <br>"My brother has continued the 'reforms' that Grand Nagus Zek put forward before he retired." He walked over to the back of the bar and pulled down a bottle of Aldebaran whiskey. "That includes income tax," he said as he poured the green liquid into a glass. "I <i>didn't</i> lower your wages. I have to take a certain amount out for taxes, which I didn't have to do before this bar became part of Ferenginar." <br> <br>Rolling her eyes, Treir said, "So now you have to actually pay taxes to support your government." <br> <br>Quark rolled his eyes right back. "I <i>don't</i> support my government. My government is run by an idiot -- I should know, I was <i>raised</i> with him. He's driving Ferenginar to ruin, and what's worse is that I have to help <i>pay</i> for it!" He took a sip of whiskey, the emerald beverage burning his throat as it went down. "And the only way I'm going to be able to pay for it is for you to stop wasting my money by standing at this bar and distracting me and getting back to your dabo table. Break's over." <br> <br>She leaned over again. Quark's eyes involuntarily went to the cleavage. Her voice now sounding like a waterfall on Bajor, she said, "What makes you think I haven't been working all this time, Quark?" Ever so gently, she traced a finger along the edge of his right lobe. <br> <br>Then she sashayed her way back to her dabo table. <br> <br>Seven men and one woman followed her as if she'd hit them with a tractor beam, and within seconds, all eight were putting money down on the table. <br> <br>For several minutes, he just stared at her. As good as Hetik had been with that Boslic woman, Treir was several orders of magnitude better with <i>all</i> her customers. She was like a Terran chameleon, always changing to suit the needs of whoever she was speaking with. She could be seductress, best friend, confidant, opponent, herald -- whatever was necessary to get people to play her game. <br> <br> <i>Let's face it, Quark,</i> he admitted to himself as he slugged down the rest of his whiskey, <i>without her, the profits wouldn't be holding steady, they'd be in the waste extractor. Rom managed to save my bar and destroy it at the same time.</i> <br> <br>He sighed. The truth was, <i>Rom</i> did save the bar. If he hadn't made Quark's into the Ferengi embassy, there would be no Quark's at all. He wasn't some Federation stooge who could somehow survive without profit. <i>A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all, and I'm nothing if I'm not a Ferengi.</i> <br> <br>"What was that, Quark?" <br> <br>Quark looked up to see Elias Vaughn. He hadn't realized he'd been speaking out loud. <i>This is what happens when you drink on the job.</i> "Just quoting the Eighteenth Rule, Commander. What can I get you?" <br> <br>The old human squinted at the bottle Quark held in his left hand. "What's that you've got there?" <br> <br>"Aldebaran whiskey." He put the bottle down on the table in front of the commander so he could examine it. <br> <br>"Don't think I've ever had it." <br> <br>Before Quark could extol the drink's virtues, he saw a very small Ferengi with very large lobes enter the bar, holding a package under his right arm. <br> <br> <i>It's about time.</i> He'd been waiting for this for <i>weeks.</i> <br> <br>Without even looking at Vaughn, he said, "Have the bottle on the house, Commander." <br> <br>It was rare that Vaughn looked surprised, though the expression barely registered with Quark. "That's unusually generous." <br> <br>Still not looking at Vaughn, busy as he was observing the new arrival's perambulations through the bar to a back table under one of the staircases, Quark said, "It's an unusual day. Excuse me." <br> <br>Signaling Frool to once again take over the bar, Quark worked his way to that same back table. Before he arrived, he made sure to inhale deeply several times, so he could hold his breath as long as possible. <br> <br>Gash was the best forger in the Ferengi Alliance, but he had never been well acquainted with the concept of bathing. <br> <br>Or, Quark noticed as he approached, dressing. The green shirt he wore was out of style ten years before it was first replicated. Not that he could see it all that clearly, since Gash's body odor was making Quark's eyes water. The two Sulamids at the next table over skittered away within thirty seconds of Gash's arrival. <br> <br>However, Quark could forgive the lost business. If the package -- which Gash had placed on the table -- was what Quark thought it was, the loss of the drinks tab of two Sulamids was a drop in the proverbial bucket. <br> <br>"I hope that's what I think it is." <br> <br>"Well, whatcha think it is, eh, Quark? Heh heh." Gash sniffled, then ran an ugly green sleeve across his bulbous nose. "Course it's whatcha think. Toldja I'd get it, didn't I? When've I ever letcha down, eh? Heh heh." <br> <br>Quark could, in fact, think of half a dozen times when Gash had let him down, but didn't think it would be politic to bring them up now. Besides, those complaints were always related to timeliness, not quality.</p><h2>The King with Six Friends</h2><p>Cheerful young King Zar&#39;s coutnry is overthrown by a rival king, who spares his life but takes everything he has save one suit of clothes and a small bag of money.

While attending Columbia University, where he earned an MFA in writing, he was hired by Troma Entertainment. He wrote the cult hit film <i>Tromeo and Juliet</i>, he wrote and starred in the acclaimed independent film <i>The Specials</i> and has written the screenplays for <i>Spy vs. Spy</i>, and <i>Scooby Doo</i> for Warner Brothers Studios. He lives in Los Angeles, CA.In the summer of 1995, a 25-year-old orderly named James Gunn starts pilfering drugs from New York City's Saint Dominic's Hospital to finance his addiction to buying the retro toys he loved while growing up in St. Louis. When he's not on one of his frequent, blind-drunk benders, having sloppy sex with random women, Jimmy basks in the magnificence of Charlie Barlow's antique toy store, where he spends thousands of dollars on TV paraphernalia, action figures, robots and games, in an attempt to recapture the few moments of beauty in his mostly horrifying childhood. Jimmy and his younger brother, Tar, survived delusional parents, cruel peers and the suicide of one of their friends by sticking together, with creative violence and wit. Those moments, sensitively told in flashback without the burden of sentimentality, often involved the boys' favorite toys, like Scrunch 'Em, Grow 'Em Dinosaurs. His pack growing up included Tar; Gary Bauer, the awkward misfit; and Nancy Zoomis, who played "I'll show you mine" with Jimmy. As the Gunn brothers matured, Tar became responsible and respectable, able to cope with his rage and bitterness about his parents and about society. But Jimmy is still an immature wastrel, who gets blotto daily and has tantrums that ruin his intimate relationships. As Jimmy attempts to heal old wounds by recollecting his painful past, he must face what his toy collection represents: a nostalgic coverup for his life's disappointments, a "longing for innocence" to quell his "rage and sadness."

The opening history of the area surrounding the Mississippi River devolves into meandering sentences that readers may find difficult to navigate (e.g., "As far back as three thousand years ago, people in the valleys of the Mississippi and the Ohio Rivers were building big burial mounds, and the river people built some of North America's first cities, such as Cahokia in what is now called Illinois"). Harness sometimes strains to interweave the story of Samuel Clemens's life and career with that of the stately steamboats' heyday. The connection is initially obvious: as a youngster, Clemens watches the steamboat operators in awe?and with envy; later he works as a pilot on the Mississippi until the outbreak of the Civil War. But as Clemens's exploits take him far from its shores, the book skips haphazardly between highlights of his life, both personal and professional, and key developments on the river where steamboats were being usurped by the more efficient railroads. The twain do meet at story's end, yet the split focus makes for a fragmented narrative that gives neither the renowned novelist nor the Queens of the Mississippi their due. Harness's detailed, energetic watercolor and colored-pencil illustrations supply a vitality and focus missing from the text. Ages 6-10. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 3-5-Harness uses Mark Twain as a focus for a historical look at the Mississippi River and the steamboats that plied her waters. A double-page spread depicting the river's early users leads into a map of the Mississippi's various tributaries and the 2,348-mile journey it makes from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. In her signature style, Harness briefly describes the Mississippi's history, while surrounding images and hand-lettered information expand the presentation. When the author reaches the early 1800s, steamboats are introduced and then, in 1835, young Samuel Clemens comes on stage. Here, Harness touches on his determination to be a river pilot and his years as a newspaperman and writer, and then returns to the river and its role in the Civil War. She concludes with the decline of the steamboat and neatly ties Clemens's last years and death back to his Mississippi River days. The time period, deftly captured through dress and background details, sets the scene for a particularly warm and vivid portrayal of the famous writer. This book makes a great companion to Kathryn Lasky's biography, A Brilliant Streak (Harcourt, 1998), and to her novel Alice Rose &amp; Sam (Hyperion, 1998), which features Sam Clemens as a major character. A fine link to the Mississippi River, to steamboats, and to Mark Twain and his books; Old Man River would be pleased.<br><i>Barbara Elleman, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Very Old Bones</h2><p>The continuation of the Phelan family saga is narrated by a bastard artist, who, estranged from the family, traces its history in paintings that document their scandals and eccentricities. By the author of Ironweed. 100,000 first printing. 100,000 ad/promo.</p><p>William Kennedy was born and raised in Albany, New York. His Albany Cycle of novels is recognised as one of the great achievements of postwar American literature, and includes LEGS, BILLY PHELAN&#39;S GREATEST GAME, IRONWEED, VERY OLD BONES, QUINN&#39;S BOOK and the FLAMING CORSAGE.Kennedy's latest installment in the Albany cycle (Billy Phelan's Greatest Game, Ironweed) continues the saga of the Phelan family in a familiar mix of surreal flourishes and gritty naturalism. Humor leavens the mix, but this one is still a grab- bag--a family chronicle that gets weighed down with too many attempts to sum up or recapitulate. It's written as a mock-memoir by Orson Purcell, ``a bit of a magician,'' who is the bastard son of Peter Phelan, older brother of Francis (Ironweed). Orson is attempting to put the humpty-dumpty of familial life together again during a climactic family gathering, in 1958, by chronicling his own life, his father's, and three past generations. Peter, a painter, returns to Albany (from a long exile in Greenwich Village) in 1954, and stays to document the family's history in paint and to care for brother Tommy, a sort of ``holy moron.'' The cast here is large and various: highlights include Francis, who returns in 1934 to attend a family funeral for matriarch Kathryn and nearly commits suicide, and Orson's own colorful interlude in Germany during the Korean War, where he meets Giselle (``I had never been more excited by a woman's body...'') and becomes a cardsharp. While some of this is thumbnail-thin, covering too much ground, Orson's narrative is finally a meditation on art, focused on father Peter, whose artistic cycle includes guilt, remorse, delight with remorse, self-destruction, boredom, and the resumption of art--``art again being the doorway into the emotional life....'' Orson's family saga, then, narrates and enlarges the pictorial one of his father: Kennedy's achievement is to place all of this into a comic structure that is, in the end, elegiac and celebratory. Tough-guy dialogue, hardheaded realism, flights of prose- -Kennedy's trademarks are here, but this one has the feel of a code: ``...we are never without our overcoats, however lice-ridden, of our ancestors.'' -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Long out of print, it is now finally accessible to a new generation of Dickens enthusiasts, who will delight in the host of supplemental texts and images, including extracts from the author's own work and from recent criticism. The rich selection of images ranges from original artwork to rare photographs and portraits of Dickens and his circle, along with specially commissioned pictures from the Charles Dickens Museum.&nbsp;</p><p>John Forster's biography of Charles Dickens was the first written, and still is the basis for much of what we know about the author. The two men met in 1837, and Forster soon became Dickens' close friend and adviser. (In fact, Dickens modeled the character of John Podsnap in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> on Forster.) Forster saw the manuscripts of nearly all of Dickens' novels before publication, and Dickens appointed him as his literary executor. Forster's biography contains many examples of personal correspondence between him and Dickens, and offers unique insight into one of the most influential writers in Western Literature.&nbsp;Holly Furneaux, PhD, teaches at the University of Leicester in the UK and has published several articles on the Victorian novel.

It details Randy Jurgensen's determined effort to bring to justice the murderer of Patrolman Phillip Cardillo, who was shot and killed inside Harlem's Mosque #7 in 1972, in the midst of an all-out assault on the NYPD from the Black Liberation Army. The New York of this era was a place not unlike the Wild West, in which cops and criminals shot it out on a daily basis.</p><p>Despite the mayhem on the streets and the Machiavellian corridors of Mayor Lindsay's City Hall, Detective Jurgensen single-handedly took on the Black Liberation Army, the Nation of Islam, NYPD brass, and City Hall, capturing Cardillo's killer, Lewis 17X Dupree. He broke the case with an unlikely accomplice, Foster 2X Thomas, a member of the Nation of Islam who became Jurgensen's witness. The relationship they formed during the time before trial gave each of the two men a greater perspective of the two sides in the street war and changed them forever. In the end, Jurgensen had to settle for a conviction on other charges, and Dupree served a number of years. The murder case is still officially unsolved. In 2006 the NYPD re-opened the case, and it is once again an active investigation with full media attention.</p><p>The book has received acclaim from current New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, as well as former Commissioner William Bratton.</p></p><p>A highly decorated veteran, Randy Jurgensen joined the NYPD in 1958.

He is the author of the number one <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers: <i>Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker Than Wrestling</i> and <i>Have a Nice Day!: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks.</i> He is also the author of two other children's books, <i>Halloween Hijinx</i> and <i>Christmas Chaos.</i> Foley wrestled professionally for over fifteen years and was the three-time World Wrestling Entertainment Champion. Foley lives with his wife and four children on Long Island.<b>April 24, 2006</b><p>Dear Hardcore Diary,</p><p>Sometimes it's all in the pitch.When it comes to presenting creative wrestling ideas, I have come to learn that the presentation of the idea is often more important than the idea itself. I have heard terrible ideas pitched magnificently, and magnificent ideas pitched terribly, so believe me when I tell you that it's all in the pitch.</p><p>A little less than four weeks ago, I participated in our biggest showcase of the year, WrestleMania. Many people thought I had been in the best match on a very good show. Sometimes it's hard for WrestleMania to live up to the hype, but in this case, I think fans went away from the arena or their television sets pleasantly surprised and extremely satisfied.</p><p>Our match was one of the intangibles of the night. I felt like a major question mark was hanging over me, as if many fans, wrestlers, and WWE office personnel wondered whether I still had what it took to deliver the goods on such a major show. Hell, I wondered myself. My knees are shot, my back is bad, my neck hurts pretty much all the time, and I've had a history of head injuries. To make things worse, I'm three bills and change, about 315 before a big meal, and on certain days, every step taken seems like a major challenge. Still, somehow, with the considerable help of a great opponent, Edge, I was able to pull it off.</p><p>But not once during the buildup to WrestleMania did I ever truly feel the story. I may have done a good job pretending, but deep down, I knew something was missing.</p><p>Passion. That's what I lacked. For some reason, I just couldn't tap into that reservoir of passion that had been one of my calling cards for so many years. A passion that allowed a not-so-good-looking guy, with a not-so-goodlooking body (a bit of an understatement there), with a lim- ited supply of athleticism, to excel in a world where good looks, athleticism, and aesthetically pleasing bodies are the rule. Or maybe there was simply nothing left to tap into. Maybe the reservoir was dry.</p><p>I currently have the dubious distinction of having the easiest contract in the WWE. I owe WWE two Pay-Per-View wrestling matches a year, and a nonwrestling appearance at one more Pay-Per-View. In addition, I am required to show up at whatever number of television tapings it takes to properly promote these appearances. So, I'm basically looking at an approximate workload of fifteen days a year. Nice, right? While I don't feel any outward resentment from the other wrestlers, I can't help but feel that I would be resenting a guy like me if I were in their shoes.</p><p>I mean these guys are on the road up to 300 days a year (some will dispute that figure, but including travel and promotional days, it gets pretty close), and most are in some degree of pain around the clock. Some awfully big guys travel an awfully long time in some awfully small coach-class airplane seats, and then do their best to put on an exciting show in a year-round business that spans a good portion of the globe. Then those sore, exhausted wrestlers are asked to step aside so an out-of-shape ghost of wrestling's past can step in and take their spot on a major Pay-Per-View.</p><p>Most of the guys on the roster genuinely like me. Some even hold me in high esteem because of what I've accomplished in the past and how much I was willing to sacrifice in order to accomplish it. But for those who may resent me, I don't blame them, especially because I haven't had the decency to show up for my ridiculously light workload with a thimbleful of the passion that's so necessary for success in today's wrestling game.</p><p>Where had it all gone? After all, it was only two years since my Backlash match with Randy Orton, a match that ended the eight-year reign of "Mind Games" with Shawn Michaels, as my personal career favorite. I'd been overflowing with passion for that match. I had thought about it nonstop, to the point of sleeplessness, to the point of obsession, to the point where every waking moment seemed filled with wild visions of thought-provoking, gutwrenching interviews, images of emotional and extremely physical, maybe even brutal, ring action.</p><p>My major challenge at Backlash 2004 was merely to take those images that were so vivid in my head and make them real in front of a microphone, and later in front of the live crowd in Edmonton and a Pay-Per-View audience around the world.</p><p>I met that challenge two years ago. I succeeded. In 2006, however, I just couldn't find the passion. I lucked out at 'Mania, but doubted I'd be so lucky when my number was called again, probably in September.</p><p>What had gone wrong in those two years? Maybe I'd just simply fallen out of love with wrestling. That happens in all facets of life, doesn't it? People simply fall out of love. But why, after all these years, had I stopped loving something that had been so good to me, something that had actually loved me back for such a long time?</p><p>Maybe it was the Ric Flair book, which had caused me to feel abandoned by WWE, due to their decision not to give me any advance warning of the literary pounding I would have to endure.</p><p>Or maybe I felt like I had taken the easy way out, by opting for the WWE contract, instead of taking a gamble with the upstart TNA promotion. My longtime buddy Raven (whose real name is Scott Levy; I actually had to ponder that for a while) had gotten in my ear and convinced me that if I were indeed to jump to TNA, it could literally make the difference between life and death for the promotion. I'll get further into my TNA temptation later in the book, as well as explain an instance where Raven inspired a major point in my novel Tietam Brown, but for now I'll just say that for a while, I did feel a certain amount of guilt concerning the decision I ultimately made.</p><p>That guilt is now gone. The passion that had been so sorely lacking has come rushing back. A giant lightbulb seemed to go off above my head, as one simple idea seemed to flush whatever creative and emotional block I had been suffering from right out of my system.</p><p>I know of several writers who create ideas simply by asking, "What if ?" What if aliens came down from outer space? What if a shy, socially repressed girl had telekinetic powers? What if a bumbling fool who'd never accomplished anything became U.S. president? All very scary scenarios, right? The idea that rekindled the fire underneath my creative ass was just as frightening, perhaps more so. What if I became the first voluntary member of the Vince McMahon "Kiss My Ass Club"?</p><p>With that one simple, repugnant thought, my long estrangement ended. I went back to the one who loved me. As it turned out, she'd never really left; she'd been waiting all along. Once reunited, the pieces all seemed to fall together, like a giant mental puzzle that I was just dying to shake up and reconstruct, only this time not just in my mind, but in front of millions around the world.</p><p>I sat on the idea for a few days, partially to let it ripen and mature in my mind, like a fine vintage wine, and partially to figure out if I was really willing to kiss another man's ass. I mean, literally kiss another man's ass. Sure, I'd been kissing the same guy's ass figuratively for a decade. But this was different. Did I really have the testicular fortitude required for such a task? On international television? In front of millions? Including my wife and kids? I checked my testicles...just as I'd hoped -- full of fortitude. </p><p>I made the call.</p><p>Copyright � 2007 by World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

Seeming at first to be merely a new eight-cylinder vee-type engine packaged in a body so similar in appearance to the Model A, many overlooked the significance of the event. Regardless, America was then embarked on an exciting automotive image and the first "primitive" Ford V-8 engine became the first of a common line that except for the War would last until 1954! Twenty-two years followed in which the basic power plant of the Ford motor car would be relatively unchanged! <p>America in its desire for the new, or the different, or the "better" went on a buying spree. Purchasers eagerly sought the "next year's model" and people everywhere became conditioned by advertising and by their environment to dispose of the old and acquire the new. True, changes were made, many of them appearances changes only, but fundamentally the differences in the succeeding Ford V-8 models were largely in appearance and these changes contributed little to the improvement of the basic item, a reliable, rugged. sturdy, and comfortable vehicle.

This charming book puts a new twist on the phenomenon by showcasing female Buddhist deities in a delightfully unusual format. Designed to resemble a Tibetan temple, the book presents stunning three-dimensional renderings of traditional thangka paintings. It features doors that open from the middle of the front cover, a sturdy tab-insert closure, and elastic loops to hold each altar firmly in place. Four important goddesses appear here. White Tara pacifies illness and removes obstacles; Vanshudara increases prosperity, fertility, and happiness; Kurukulla helps attract and influence through the power of love and desire; and Vajrayogini aids in developing the enlightened union of Great Bliss and Emptiness. With the assistance of these colorful altars and an informative text about the symbolic art, visualization can blossom into multidimensional meditation.</p><p>Unusual book</p><h2>People in Trouble</h2><p>A New York City love triangle forms the center of a literary universe peopled by a Guardian Angels-like vigilante group, a Chinatown cowgirl, and ex-leather queen, a real-estate mogul, and, at the center, Kate, Peter, and Molly, as they confront love in the time of AIDS</p><p>AIDS is a metaphor for "the beginning of the end of the world" in this dark gay-lesbian novel about Kate, a married artist dabbling in lesbian sex, Molly, her lesbian/activist lover, and Peter, Kate's Yuppie scene designer husband, who is confused by not only his wife's increasing interest in the gay world, but by the increasing gayness of the world itself. They play out their story in a futuristic New York City, where a radical gay group robs banks to help AIDS patients. Though Schulman has talent, the sophisticated, New York flavor of the book and the often inaccessibility of the characters leave little for many readers to identify with, and the graphic gay sex scenes may be offensive to conservative audiences. Nevertheless, Schulman creates a disturbing picture of the plight of humanity and our seeming indifference, a theme which cuts across strictly gay borders.

It has nothing to do with existence or the exotic. It is almost entirely an inner experience. <br>&#x2014; <b>FRESH AIR FIEND</b><br>&nbsp;<br>The exotic dream, not always outlandish, is a dream of what we lack and so crave. And in the world of the exotic, which is always an old world peopled by the young or ageless, time stands still. <br>&#x2014; <b>SUNRISE WITH SEAMONSTERS</b><br>&nbsp;<br>It is sometimes the way in travel, when travel becomes its opposite: you roll and roll and then dawdle to a halt in the middle of nowhere. Rather than making a conscious decision, you simply stop rolling.<br>&#x2014; <b>GHOST TRAIN TO THE EASTERN STAR</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Whatever else travel is, it is also an occasion to dream and remember. You sit in an alien landscape and you are visited by all the people who have been awful to you. You have nightmares in strange beds. You recall episodes that you have not thought of for years, and but for that noise from the street or that powerful odor of jasmine you might have forgotten. <br>&#x2014; <b>FRESH AIR FIEND</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Because travel is often a sad and partly masochistic pleasure, the arrival in obscure and picturesquely awful places is one of the delights of the traveler.<br>&nbsp;&#x2014; <b>THE PILLARS OF HERCULES</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In travel, as in many other experiences in life, once is usually enough. <br>&#x2014; <b>THE PILLARS OF HERCULES</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In travel you meet people who try to lay hold of you, who take charge like parents, and criticize. Another of travel&#x2019;s pleasures was turning your back on them and leaving and never having to explain. <br>&#x2014; <b>THE KINGDOM BY THE SEA</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Travel is flight and pursuit in equal parts. <br>&#x2014; <b>THE GREAT RAILWAY BAZAAR</b><br>&nbsp;<br>All travel is circular . . .

It is one of the greatest reasons to go anywhere. <br>&#x2014; <b>THE PILLARS OF HERCULES</b><br>&nbsp;<br>It might be said that a great unstated reason for travel is to find places that exemplify where one has been happiest. Looking for idealized versions of home &#x2014; indeed, looking for the perfect memory. <br>&#x2014; <b>FRESH AIR FIEND</b><br>&nbsp;<br>When strangers asked me where I was going I often replied, &#x201c;Nowhere.&#x201d; Vagueness can become a habit, and travel a form of idleness.<br>&nbsp;&#x2014; <b>THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Travel holds the magical possibility of reinvention: that you might find a place you love, to begin a new life and never go home. <br>&#x2014; <b>GHOST TRAIN TO THE EASTERN STAR</b><br>&nbsp;<br>One of the happier and more helpful delusions of travel is that one is on a quest. <br>&#x2014; <b>GHOST TRAIN TO THE EASTERN STAR</b><br>&nbsp;<br>I had gotten to Lower Egypt and was heading south in my usual traveling mood &#x2014; hoping for the picturesque, expecting misery, braced for the appalling. Happiness was unthinkable, for although happiness is desirable it is a banal subject for travel; therefore, Africa seemed a perfect place for a long journey. <br>&#x2014; <b>DARK STAR SAFARI</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Invention in travel accords with Jorge Luis Borges&#x2019;s view, floated beautifully through his poem &#x201c;Happiness&#x201d; (La Dicha), that in our encounters with the world, &#x201c;everything happens for the first time.&#x201d; Just as &#x201c;whoever embraces a woman is Adam,&#x201d; and &#x201c;whoever lights a match in the dark is inventing fire,&#x201d; anyone&#x2019;s first view of the Sphinx sees it new: &#x201c;In the desert I saw the young Sphinx, which has just been sculpted . . .

With Americans, it is a national trait, as native to us as the rollercoaster or the jukebox. It is no simple longing for the hometown or country of our birth.

Her father is a famous and fascinating novelist; her older brother, though mentally handicapped, possesses an almost magical gift for musical composition. The lives of both father and son revolve around their work and each other, and her mother&#39;s life is devoted to the care of them both. She and her younger brother find themselves emotionally on the outside of this oddly constructed nuclear family. But when her father leaves Japan to accept a visiting professorship from a distinguished American university, Ma-Chan finds herself suddenly the head of the household and the center of family relationships that she must begin to redefine.</p><p>Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe has produced a quirky, introspective novel that uses autobiographical elements to tell the story of a writer&#39;s family and his rediscovery of his place therein. Written in the form of a diary, the story is told from the point of view of Ma-Chan, the daughter of a famous writer (identified only as &#34;K&#34;) who has decamped to California as a university writer-in-residence. Ma-Chan is left in charge of her equally famous brother, an idiot savant who composes brilliant classical music. The mentally retarded brother, nicknamed Eeyore, has violent fits, periods of incontinence, and a troubling new sexual awareness. Like Faulkner&#39;s Benjy Compson, he is the moral center of the book, a touchstone and a catalyst for the muted events that carry the novel to its unpredictable close. Full of digressions on the cinema, modernist music, and the novels of Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Oe&#39;s latest novel is a stylized, idiosyncratic confessional that only he could fashion.Kenzaburo Oe begins a visiting professorship at Princeton University in the fall of 1996.</p><h2>In the Words of E.

The quotations cover a wide range of subjects and situations, from Automobiles, Babies, Bees, City Life, and College to Spiders, Taxes, Weather, Work, and Worry. E. B. White comments on writing for children, how to tell a major poet from a minor one, and what to do when one becomes hopelessly mired in a sentence. White was apt to address the subject of security by speaking first about a Ferris wheel at the local county fair, or the subject of democracy from the perspective of roofing his barn and looking out across the bay&#x2015;he had a gift for bringing the abstract firmly into the realm of the everyday.

They were used for sightseeing excursions, bombing London in World War I, exploring the Arctic, carrying airplanes, and then carrying passengers in luxurious comfort on transoceanic routes. Though each of these roles ended in a deadly catastrophe, a famously flaming one for the <i>Hindenburg</i>, the image of these stately behemoths persists in the imagination. Yesteryear soars spectacularly with this glossy album. Hundreds of photos restore the wonderment the zeppelins induced wherever they flew, as many frames include the gawking crowds they attracted. The text artfully supports the illustrations (and original paintings by Marschall) with details on the birth of rigid-frame designs, the delicacy of flying them, their promotion in the 1920s as superior to airplanes, and the peak of their development with the LZ 129, as the <i>Hindenburg</i> was designated before the Nazis pasted their flag and the wooden titan's name on it. A fine publishing concept gracefully executed, this work is prime public library material. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i>This lavish volume on dirigibles will receive a 75,000-copy first printing.<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wavetops at My Wingtips: Flying With Raf Bomber and Coastal Commands in World War II</h2><p>Leslie &#39;Bav&#39; Baveystock sank two U Boats in the summer of 1944 when flying a Short Sunderland flying boat in Coastal Command. Earlier in the war he flew as second pilot aboard an elderly Bomber Command Avro Manchester on the first 1,000 bomber raid. When returning from Cologne his aircraft was hit and seriously damaged by flak. With only one engine powering the bomber it was steadily losing height and the pilot ordered the crew to jump. The crew, except for the pilot, landed safely and eventually escaped occupied territory via the renowned Comet Line escape route. Baveystock was transferred to No 201 Squadron, Coastal Command, where he flew Sunderlands on long-range Atlantic patrols. His first success was the locating and attacking the German armed blockade-runner Alsterufer. In June 1944, when flying a patrol to protect the D-Day landings, U-995 was sighted in the Western Approaches. Baveystock immediately attacked, dropping flares to illuminate the submarine and dropped depth charges from a mere seventy feet, dispatching the U Boat to the bottom. On August 18th of that same year he sank U-107!</p><p></p><h2>The Walking Dead, Compendium Three HARDCOVER</h2><p>Just in time for the new season of The Walking Dead on AMC, the fan- favorite, New York Times bestselling series returns with its third massive paperback collection!

Her work has appeared in numerous publications and books, including Abrams&#39; Roadside America: The Automobile and the American Dream. Lewis is also the photographer of Abrams&#39; Sun-Drenched Gordens: The Mediterranean Style. She lives in Los Angeles.One of pop culture's universal truths is that Americans have carried on an unabashed romance with the automobile since its invention around the turn of the twentieth century. This rich, oversize album by a renowned car photographer, who refers to herself as a "classic car junkie," will touch the heartstrings of those who feel the romance of the road. In more than 200 color photographs, Lewis "poses" splendid examples of cars from throughout the history of the American automobile industry at planned locations where cars traditionally "hang out," such as at drive-in restaurants, drive-in movie theaters, motels, and diners, or in desert settings, or with golden fields in the background. These beautiful shots reflect Lewis' conviction that "cars are most themselves in their natural habitat. They belong on the road. And they belong to the road." We see cars in elegant profile or provocative full face; we see luxury cars (Imperial), sports cars (Corvette), and utility cars (Grand Cherokee). The bright, spirited, and informative text provides excellent mortar holding the photographs together. <i>Brad Hooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Bean Fly-Fishing Handbook</h2><p>Surveys the basic equipment of fly fishing, explains how to tie flies, and offers practical advice on fly casting</p><p>The name L. L. Bean is acknowledged as being the tops in outdoor gear. This handbook justifiably bears that brand. A handsomely illustrated Text enhanced with photographs, Dave Whitlock&#39;s book covers the Zen of fly fishing, the craft or how-to, the strategies for various fish, how to &#34;read&#34; both fish and stream, and describes the art of tying various flies, and the latest in fly- fishing attire.

But Vladimir Nabokov's wise, ironic, elegant masterpiece owes its stature as one of the twentieth century's novels of record not to the controversy its material aroused but to its author's use of that material to tell a love story almost shocking in its beauty and tenderness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Awe and exhilaration&#x2013;along with heartbreak and mordant wit&#x2013;abound in this account of the aging Humbert Humbert's obsessive, devouring, and doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze. Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America, but most of all, it is a meditation on love&#x2013;love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation. With an introduction by Martin Amis.</p><p><br>(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)</p><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Despite its lascivious reputation, the pleasures of <i>Lolita</i> are as much intellectual as erogenous. It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

Orman has parlayed her popular renown as both a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and video-age financial guru into an undeniable position of respect and trust when it comes to matters of dollars and sense.

Two years earlier, an unforeseen flood of refugees from the East Germanic tribe known as the Goths had arrived at the Empire's eastern border, seeking admittance. Though usually successful in dealing with barbarian groups, in this instance the Roman authorities failed. Gradually coalesced into an army led by Fritigern, the barbarian horde inflicted on Emperor Valens the most disastrous defeat suffered by the Roman army since Hannibal's victory at Cannae almost 600 years earlier. The Empire did not actually fall for another century, but some believe this battle signaled nothing less than the end of the ancient world and the start of the Middle Ages.</p><p>With impeccable scholarship and narrative flair, renowned historian Alessandro Barbero places the battle in its historical context, chronicling the changes in the Roman Empire, west and east, the cultural dynamics at its borders, and the extraordinary administrative challenge in holding it together. Vividly recreating the events leading to the clash, he brings alive leaders and common soldiers alike, comparing the military tactics and weaponry of the barbarians with those of the disciplined Roman army as the battle unfolded on that epic afternoon. Narrating one of the turning points in world history, <i>The Day of the Barbarians</i> is military history at its very best.</p></p><p><p><b>Alessandro Barbero </b>is a professor of Medieval Studies at the University of Piemonte Orientale in Vercelli, Italy. A previous winner of the Strega Prize, Italy's most distinguished literary award, he is the author of <i>The Battle: A New History of Waterloo</i>, and <i>Charlemagne: Father of a Continent</i>.</p>Medievalist Barbero (<i>The Battle: A New History of Waterloo</i>) offers a revisionist history of the relatively obscure battle of Adrianople, arguing that the course of world history changed after the clash in 378, in the eastern Roman province of Thrace, between an army of Goths and a Roman imperial army. The battle resulted in an overwhelming barbarian victory&#x2014;the eastern emperor Valens died along with two-thirds of his army&#x2014;setting in motion a train of events that led directly to "the fall of the western Roman Empire," according to Barbero. Rejecting the traditional view that Rome's decline was well underway by the fourth century, Barbero claims that by the eve of the battle of Adrianople, the empire's earlier problems "seemed to be... under control." To reconstitute the imperial army after the devastating losses at Adrianople, the Romans had to turn to the Goths, whose loyalty depended on how well they were paid. Eventually, the barbarians&#x2014;despite their questionable loyalty&#x2014;became "indispensable" for the defense and administration of the empire. When their interest and Rome's diverged, the western empire's fate was sealed. While Barbero's thesis is sure to spark debate among scholars and students, his sprightly prose makes this slim volume accessible to a general audience. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, twenty years later, Graham returns with a new selection, this time from eleven volumes, including previously unpublished work, which, in its breathtaking overview, illuminates of the development of her remarkable poetry thus far.</p><p>In <em>From the New World&#x2014;Poems 1976-2014</em>, we can witness the unfolding of Graham&#x2019;s signature ethical and eco-political concerns, as well as her deft exploration of mythology, history, love and, increasingly, love of the world in a time of crisis. As the work evolves, the depth of compassion grows&#x2014;gradually transforming, widening and expanding her extraordinary formal resources and her inimitable style.</p><p>These pages present a brilliant portrait one of the major voices of American contemporary poetry. As critic Calvin Bedient says, &#x201c;If Graham has proved oversized as a poet in the field of contemporary poetry, it is because she continually recalls the great Western tradition of philosophical and religious inquiry . . . tenaciously thinking and feeling her way through layer after layer of perception, like no poet before her.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>From pulitzer prize winner Jorie Graham, an indispensable volume of poems selected from almost four decades of work</p><p>Much awaited and long needed, <em>From the New World</em>&#x2014;a sequence of poems from Jorie Graham&#x2019;s prior eleven books&#x2014;creates a startlingly fresh trajectory through books whose brilliance and far-reaching innovations have been a significant influence on the landscape of contemporary poetry, both in the United States and abroad. Part spiritual autobiography, part survival manual, <em>From the New World</em> tracks what it is to attempt wakefulness in this our unprecedented historical, social, and ecological crisis. Life as we have known it, both in our persons and on the globe, rises in all its terror and deep mystery from these pages. How are we to be responsible, the book asks; how attend to drastic disappearance and still love? We finally have, in one volume, the stunning story Graham has written to keep both art and the human spirit instantaneously yet enduringly alive.</p><p>&#x201c;<em>From the New World</em> is an indispensable addition to any literary library, a tour de force selection of Jorie Graham&#x2019;s critically important poems to date.&#x201d;<em>&#x2014;New York Journal of Books</em></p><p>&#x201c;Graham&#x2019;s great body of work, summarized in <em>From the New World,</em> her new career-spanning selected poems...has so much in it, more of life and of the world than that of almost any other poet now writing....Graham is to post-1980 poetry what Bob Dylan is to post-1960 rock: She changed her art form, moved it forward, made it able to absorb and express more than it could before. It permanently bears her mark.&#x201d;<em>&#x2014;New York Times </em></p><p>&#x201c;Graham&#x2019;s poems make use of all the old lyric technologies, as ancient as the breath and the beating of the heart&#x2014;rhythm, the managed intervals of line and stanza, the play of language against silence, and the transformations enacted by metaphor&#x2014;enlisting them to measure a world of spawning complexity and change. But because she finds herself gauged by the world she gauges, a poetry that would seem almost too fine-grained for politics has become, in the past twenty years or so, a sui-generis account of global ills like species extinction and climate change.&#x201d;<em>&#x2014; The New Yorker</em></p><p>&#x201c;Like the greatest filmmakers, Graham is miraculously gifted at tracing those inexplicable moments that carry a thing&#x2014;a crow, the sun, a snowflake&#x2014;from stillness to motion, from wholeness to disintegration and back again....I know of no living poet whose work so aligns with their reason for writing; I know of no living poet with a better reason for writing poetry. In Jorie Graham&#x2019;s vision of a new world, poetry&#x2014;thought in motion&#x2014;is faster and more powerful than money, argument, or destruction. Take me there.&#x201d;&#x2014;Flavorwire</p><p>&#x201c;Graham&#x2019;s is the best poetry written in English in the last forty years. The achievement of her verse is not only to make something happen: Graham&#x2019;s poetry is something happening....We will always need to read Jorie Graham, and to read her closely, if we want to understand the last forty years of poetry in America (as well as abroad, where her reputation is only growing)....<em>From the New World</em> is now the place to start.&#x201d; <em>&#x2014;Los Angeles Review of Books</em></p><p>Jorie Graham is the author of twelve collections of poetry, including <em>The Dream of the Unified Field</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she teaches at Harvard University. The recipient of numerous awards, including the Pulitzer, the Forward Prize and the International Nonino Prize,&nbsp;Graham's work is widely translated. </p></p><h2>Diamonds Are Forever</h2><p>&#39;The twentieth century looked out at him from the piece of newsprint and bared its teeth in a sneer&#39; From the diamond mines of Sierra Leone to the jewellers of Hatton Garden, from race track to casino...Bond must infiltrate and destroy the criminal network of the Spangled Mob in Fleming&#39;s fourth 007 adventure.</p><p>Ian Lancaster Fleming was born in London on 28 May 1908 and was educated at Eton College before spending a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters news agency, followed by a brief spell as a stockbroker. On the outbreak of the Second World War he was appointed assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral Godfrey, where he played a key part in British and Allied espionage operations. After the war he joined Kemsley Newspapers as Foreign Manager of the Sunday Times, running a network of correspondents who were intimately involved in the Cold War. His first novel, Casino Royale, was published in 1953 and introduced James Bond, Special Agent 007, to the world. The first print run sold out within a month. Following this initial success, he published a Bond title every year until his death. His own travels, interests and wartime experience gave authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler hailed him as `the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#39; The fifth title, From Russia with Love, was particularly well received and sales soared when President Kennedy named it as one of his favourite books. The Bond novels have sold more than sixty million copies and inspired a hugely successful film franchise which began in 1962 with the release of Dr No starring Sean Connery as 007. The Bond books were written in Jamaica, a country Fleming fell in love with during the war and where he built a house, `Goldeneye&#39;. He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only child Caspar, went on to become the well-loved novel and film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Fleming died of heart failure on 12 August 1964, aged fifty-six. www.ianfleming.com<p>With its two fighting claws held forward like a wrestler's arms the big pandinus scorpion emerged with a dry rustle from the finger-sized hole under the rock.</p> <p>There was a small patch of hard, flat earth outside the hole and the scorpion stood in the centre of this on the tips of its four pairs of legs, its nerves and muscles braced for a quick retreat and its senses questing for the minute vibrations which would decide its next move.</p> <p>The moonlight, glittering down through the great thorn bush, threw sapphire highlights off the hard, black polish of the six-inch body and glinted palely on the moist white sting which protruded from the last segment of the tail, now curved over parallel with the scorpion's flat back. Slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed. The scorpion had decided. Greed had won over fear.</p> <p>Twelve inches away, at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand, the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush, and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings. The beetle's legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body, and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpion's head and immediately he was dead.</p> <p>After it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes. During this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations. Reassured, its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetle's flesh. Then for an hour, and with extreme fastidiousness, the scorpion ate its victim.</p> <p>The great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of Kissidougou in the south-western corner of French Guinea. On all horizons there were hills and jungle, but here, over twenty square miles, there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush, perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots, had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away.</p> <p>The bush grew more or less at the junction of three African states. It was in French Guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of Liberia and five miles east of the frontier of Sierra Leone. Across this frontier are the great diamond mines around Sefadu. These are the property of Sierra International, which is part of the powerful mining empire of Afric International, which in turn is a rich capital asset of the British Commonwealth.</p> <p>An hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations. First there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle's movements, and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognised and diagnosed. Then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion's hole. These were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency. After a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued, and it was greed for the beetle that, after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy, the sun, finally got the upper hand against the scorpion's memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight.</p> <p>And now, as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off its feeding pincers, the signal for the scorpion's own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon, audible to a human, but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpion's sensory system.</p> <p>And, a few feet away, a heavy, blunt hand, with bitten finger nails, softly raised a jagged piece of rock. There was no noise, but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it. At once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail, its near-sighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy.</p> <p>The heavy stone came down.</p> <p>'Black bastard.'</p> <p>The man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony.</p> <p>The man yawned. He got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and, his arms bent protectingly over his head, scrambled out into the open.</p> <p>The noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for, and which had signed the scorpion's death warrant, was louder. As the man stood and stared up the path of the moon, he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades.</p> <p>The man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding place. Below the pillion, on either side, there were leather toolboxes. From one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin. From the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where, fifty yards from the big horns bush, there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court. At three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on. Then, the last torch alight in his hand, he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited.</p> <p>The helicopter was moving slowly towards him, not more than a hundred feet from the ground, the big rotor blades idling. It looked like a huge, badly constructed insect. To the man on the ground it seemed, as usual, to be making too much noise.</p> <p>The helicopter paused, pitching slightly, directly over his head. An arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him. It flashed dot-dash, the morse for A.</p> <p>The man on the ground flashed back a B and a C. He stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away, shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust. Above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches. The clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough, the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral, and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt.</p> <p>In the echoing silence, a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush, and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird.</p> <p>After a pause to let the dust settle, the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit, pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground. He waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches. The pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other man's inevitable complaint. He despised all Afrikaners. This one in particular. To a Reichsdeutscher and to a Luftwaffe pilot who had fought under Galland in defence of the Reich they were a bastard race, sly, stupid and ill-bred. Of course this brute had a tricky job, but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night, and then taking it back again.</p> <p>As the other man came up, the pilot half raised his hand in greeting. 'Everything all right?'</p> <p>'I hope so. But you're late again. I shall only just make it through the frontier by first light.'</p> <p>'Magneto trouble. We all have our worries. Thank God there are only thirteen full moons a year. Well, if you've got the stuff let's have it and we'll tank her up and I'll be off.'</p> <p>Without speaking, the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and handed over the neat, heavy packet.</p> <p>The pilot took it. It was damp with the sweat from the smuggler's ribs. The pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt. He put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts.</p> <p>'Good,' he said. He turned towards his machine.</p> <p>'Just a moment,' said the diamond smuggler. There was a sullen note in his voice.</p> <p>The pilot turned back and faced him. He thought: it's the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food. 'Ja. What is it?'</p> <p>'Things are getting too hot. At the mines. I don't like it at all. There's been a big intelligence man down from London. You've read about him. This man Sillitoe. They say he's been hired by the Diamond Corporation. There've been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled. It's frightened out some of my smaller men. I had to be ruthless and, well, one of them somehow fell into the crusher. That tightened things up a bit. But I've had to pay more. An extra ten per cent. And they're still not satisfied. One of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen. And you know these black swine. They can't stand a real beating.' He looked swiftly into the pilot's eyes and then away again. 'For the matter of that I doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok. Not even me.'</p> <p>'So?' said the pilot. He paused. 'Do you want me to pass this threat back to ABC?'</p> <p>'I'm not threatening anyone,' said the other man hastily.' I just want them to know that it's getting tough. They must know it themselves. They must know about this man Sillitoe. And look what the Chairman said in our annual report. He said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smug-gling and IDE and that it was up to the government to stop it. And what does that mean? It means "stop me"!'</p> <p>'And me,' said the pilot mildly. 'So what do you want? More money?'</p> <p>'Yes,' said the other man stubbornly. 'I want a bigger cut. Twenty per cent more or I'll have to quit.'

But homework is the least of Darren&#39;s problems. Bodies are piling up. Time is running out. And the past is catching up with the hunters fast!</p><p>Darren Shan was born in London but at an early age he moved to Limerick, Ireland, with his parents and younger brother. He grew up watching old Dracula horror movies and reading spooky comics, which were the inspirations for this series. Allies of the Night is his eighth novel in the Cirque Du Freak series.<br><br>Grade 6-8&#x2013;Darren Shan, a 21st-century vampire prince, and his friends, Mr. Crepsley and Harkat, are on a quest to stop the Lord of the Vampaneze. When a series of murders takes place in Mr. Crepsley's hometown, they stop the search for the evil lord to look for the murderer, whom they suspect is also vampaneze. School officials become aware that Darren, who looks like a 15-year-old despite actually being 20+, is in town, and he is forced to attend school. His English teacher, Debbie Hemlock, is his ex-girlfriend, all grown-up. Darren is attacked by a hooked-hand creature and is saved by his childhood friend, Steve. Soon, acquaintances and classmates are being slain, and Darren, Mr. Crepsley, and Harkat, as well as Debbie and Steve, begin tracking the killer through underground tunnels. This horror/mystery tale takes a strange twist when Steve's motives to aid the friends are exposed and Debbie is taken hostage. The plot moves slowly until the killings begin, but then the story takes off. Darren is a likable hero, but other characters are not well developed. Gory fight and murder scenes and some profanity are included, but are in keeping with the story line. Fans of the series will enjoy this cliff-hanger and look forward to the next installment.<i>&#x2013;Heather Ver Voort, Washington West Elementary, Olean, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Hornet's Nest</i>, her page-turning novel about crime and police in Charlotte, North Carolina, Cornwell moved behind the badges of these real-life heroes to uncover flesh-and-blood characters who strode through her pages to reveal vulnerable, passionate, brave, sometimes doubting, always fascinating figures.</p><p> In <i>Southern Cross</i>, Cornwell takes us even closer to the personal and professional lives of big-city police, in a story of corruption, scandal, and robberies that escalate to murder. This time, her setting is Richmond, Virginia, where Charlotte Police Chief Judy Hammer has been brought by an NIJ grant to clean up the police force. Reeling from the recent death of her husband, and resented by the police force, city manager, and mayor of Richmond, Hammer is joined by her deputy chief Virginia West and rookie Andy Brazil on the most difficult assignment of her career. In the face of overwhelming public scrutiny, the trio must bring truth, order, and sanity to a city in trouble.</p></p><p>In their first appearance (<i>Hornet's Nest</i>, 1997), Chief Judy Hammer, Deputy Virginia West, and reporter-turned-rookie-cop Andy Brazil battled a serial killer in Charlotte, North Carolina. Now, in Patricia Cornwell's <i>Southern Cross</i>, the trio are dispatched to Richmond, Virginia--via an NIJ (National Institute of Justice) grant--to quell the growing gang problem and modernize the beleaguered Richmond PD. They bring with them a sophisticated computer program for tracking criminal activity and a tried-and-true methodology for reforming Richmond's men and women in blue. Unfortunately, Hammer, Brazil, and West could not have been prepared for the resentment they would confront... or the bizarre cast of characters they would find upon their arrival: Lelia Ehrhart--wealthy (and nosey) chair of the Blue Ribbon Crime Commission--whose heavy European accent renders her English dangerously hilarious; Butner "Bubba" Flunk IV--tobacco industry worker, gun collector, and UFO aficionado; Smoke--the sociopathic leader of the Pikes gang; and Weed Gardener--14-year-old painter turned master graffiti artist.<p> Unlike Cornwell's usual fare, <i>Southern Cross</i> is driven almost exclusively by an interest in these strange personalities and their surreal hometown, rather than in fast-paced thrills. The novel becomes a satire on city politics, Southern culture, the ever-tense relationship between the police and the public, and the struggles of the average man and woman with computer technology. Cornwell does fall down in a few places. First, her description of the computer virus that somehow infects police department Web sites from Richmond to New York seems a bit far-fetched. Also, her narrative, divided among three major characters, loses its focus and sags at several points. In the end, though, <i>Southern Cross</i> is redeemed by Cornwell's inimitable renderings of police work and the quotidian life of Richmond's many odd denizens. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Patricia Cornwell</b>&nbsp;is considered one of the world's bestselling crime writers.

Throughout the years his passion continued to grow, and soon Nate was heading his own award-winning firm with an elite roster of clients.<br><br> But it was Oprah Winfrey who gave Nate the chance of a lifetime--the opportunity to go into millions of homes around the world and join her mission to help people live their best lives. "It has been a dream come true that has absolutely changed my life," explains Berkus. "Not only has working with Oprah helped me redefine my own vision and purpose--but she continues to challenge me to use my own life to help others live better. And there is nothing that makes me happier or more grateful than to be a part of that." As Oprah always says, "Your home should be a reflection of who you truly are." Nate says, no matter how much money you have, he believes that is so very true. "I am honored to share my love of design to help everyone make that dream real for themselves with this book."</p><p>Nate Berkus began his career in design at a young age. With his allowance (dedicated to buying things for his bedroom) and his mother's influence (she's also a decorator), Nate began a lifelong passion for design. After graduating from Lake Forest College, he took a job with Leslie Hindman Auctioneers. It was from this position, as well as an internship with Dominique Aurientis in Paris, France, that he really developed a love for and good knowledge of the decorative arts and furniture. Nate then went on to form Nate Berkus Associates in 1995 at the age of twenty-four. The firm grew to include projects for Wolfgang Puck's Spago, Barney's New York, W hotels, as well as a prestigious list of private homes and clients. In 2001, Nate was invited to make over a small space for <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>. From there, Nate became a featured design expert for the show and continued on to become a regular contributor to<em>O at Home</em> magazine.</p><h2>Keep the Lights Burning, Abbie (Reading Rainbow Book)</h2><p>From Summary on back cover: &#34;...based on the true story of Abbie Burgess, who, in 1856, single-handedly kept the lighthouse lit during a tremendous storm off the coast of Maine...&#34;</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No BioGrade 1-3 Based on a true story of an 1856 storm off the coast of Maine, Abbie's tale is one of endurance and bravery. When her father, the lighthouse keeper, sails off for supplies, he leaves Abbie in charge of lighting the oil lamps in the twin towers of their lighthouse and making sure that they don't go out. When a huge storm hits, preventing her father from returning for four weeks, Abbie keeps those lamps burning, getting up several times each night to climb the towers to check them, scraping ice from the windows so the lights can be seen at sea. In the course of the storm, she also rescues her chickens from a huge wave, thus saving the family's only source of food. The Roops allow the natural drama of Abbie's story to emerge in simple sentences that are sometimes cut up awkwardly, but for the most part they are clear and compelling. An author's note gives the interesting historical basis of the story, but the tale stands alone as an exciting account of a young girl's courage. The vivid watercolor paintings are highly effective in detailing Abbie's job as well as creating atmosphere. All in all, one of the best historical beginning-to-readsa refreshing cold blast of salty real life.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Children of the Yangtze River</h2><p>Mei Mei and Chang&#39;s life in their Chinese village takes a drastic turn after the Yangtze River begins to rise and sweeps the houses, trees, animals, and people along its path</p><p></p><h2>Carrier Strike: The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands,October 1942</h2><p>Eric Hammel.

Here is their story in all its richness and complexity. Tim Pat Coogan traveled around the world where green is indeed worn to talk to the people who weaved the tale of "a dream born in a herdsman's shed and the secret scriptures of the poor." Along with American presidents, best-selling authors and Riverdancers, Ireland gave the world a caring tradition borne by missionaries and teachers who spread a message of hope and the panorama of their life abroad comes alive in this magisterial work.<br></p><p>Far more Irishmen live outside Ireland than within it. This fascinating study by Ireland?s best-known and most controversial contemporary historian, reveals why this is, how it has come about and what the political, economic, religious and cultural realities are today for the populations of the ?Irish Diaspora? in the countries they now inhabit.<b>Tim Pat Coogan</b> is one of the best known journalists and historians in Ireland.

Their mastery of delicious home-cooked dishes and comfort food makes them the ideal source for this cookbook. Author Pat Tanumihardja has assembled 130 tantalizing dishes from real Chinese fried rice to the classic Filipino Chicken Adobo to the ultimate Japanese comfort dish Oyako donburi. This is hearty food, brightly flavored, equally good to look at and eat. Flavors range from soy and ginger to hot chiles, fragrant curries, and tart vinegars. The author has translated all of the recipes to work in modern home kitchens. Many of them have been handed down from mother to daughter for generations without written recipes, and some appear in tested and written form for the first time. An exhaustive Asian Pantry glossary explains the ingredients, from the many kinds of rice and curries to unfamiliar but flavorful vegetables.</p><p>The kitchen goddess is definitely the Asian American grandmother. She is the glue that holds the family together; the keeper of cultural and culinary tradition; the source of all things delicious, pungent, salty, and satisfying. Pull up a chair at the kitchen table and pick up some chopsticks--grandmothers who cook Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Indonesian, Thai, and Indian cuisine are in the kitchen stirring up culinary delights for you. What's your favorite? Crispy Shrimp Rolls or Shiu Mai or a satisfying bowl of Nepalese Nine-Bean Soup? <br><br>To compile the recipes for this gratifyingly expansive cookbook, author Patricia Tanumihardja (whose grandmother hailed from Indonesia) served as cultural historian, recipe transcriber, and surrogate granddaughter. How else could she garner the recipes for such dishes as Water Spinach with Shrimp Paste and Chilies, Pan- Fried Tofu Simmered in Sweet Miso Sauce, or Grandma Yangja's Cabbage Kimchi? These are the authentic dishes you don't necessarily find in restaurants: Steamed Meatballs with Tangerine Peel, Gingered Oxtail Stew, 1-2-3-4-5 Sticky Spareribs, and Clay Pot Lemongrass-Steamed Fish. And if you believe that the noodle was invented by an Asian grandmother, you are ready for a bowl of Pancit (Filipino Fried Noodles) or Ohn No Khauk Swe (Chicken Coconut Noodle Soup). This beautiful culinary tour of Asian American kitchens makes many cultural stops, with a panoply of flavors and a bountiful menu of dishes along the way. So even if you aren't fortunate enough to have an Asian grandmother yourself, double happiness can be yours by sharing and enjoying these enduring recipes."America is a land of immigrants, and Patricia Tanumihardja's soulful work illuminates how Asian women--queens of their family kitchens--enrich our flavorful culinary landscape."--Andrea Nguyen, author of Into the Vietnamese Kitchen and Asian Dumplings<br>"My own first, and lastingly wonderful, impressions of Japan were of obachan (grandmothers); their food and stories continue to nourish me decades later.

I just love goin' through all the recipe cards they passed on to me and readin' their handwritten notes; it makes me remember our good times in the kitchen, gathered round the table. Sometimes, though, I need a little remindin' when it comes to writin' down my own recipes and recollections, so I've put together this darlin' little journal to get me (and you) started recordin'. I know I never forget a meal, but I also know that Jamie and Bobby aren't always listenin' to what I'm tellin' 'em. <br> <br> So for you and the boys, I've included some tried-and-true recipes and some of my hard-learned tricks for gettin' out of culinary scrapes -- and Lord, honey, have there been a few. Whether it is a real disaster -- the boss and his wife are comin' over and the kitchen is full of smoke (no shame in servin' some takeout) -- or just an everyday bump in the road -- your husband didn't hear the buzzer, and the cake got a little dry in the oven (let some sugar water soak into those layers, and no one will know the difference) -- I've got your answer. Just get cookin' and let loose: nothin' makes memories like the smell of home-cooked meals. Jot down your ingredients and your musings, cut out a recipe card or two to share with friends, keep track of who came to dinner, who liked what, and who laughed the loudest; remember the good times and learn from the bad. Like I always say, there's not much in life you can't learn in the kitchen. <br> <br> Paula Deen</p><p>Paula Deen is the bestselling author of thirteen books and an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning Food Network television star.

She was a masterful cook, but more than that, she loved me, and the wise words she gave me about how she felt about cookin' and how to ripen fruits and break bread and fix the occasional cookin' calamity were far more important than even her wonderful recipes. I wish I'd had a kind of journal then, to write down all those grandmomma-wise words along with my own ideas that popped up as I watched her chop pecans for her fresh apple cake. My best thoughts on life still seem to appear when I'm stirrin' my pots, and the freshest impressions and even the sweetest memories of family and friends come bubblin' up along with the intoxicatin' smells from the jambalaya on my stove. </p><p> Take this old story I heard when I was very small. There was this young wife who asked her momma why the momma always cut a little bit offin' the butt end of a pork roast before she cooked it. Because, the momma explained, it tastes better because the juices are released easier and because her momma cooked it that way and because <i>her</i> momma did the same. </p><p> The young woman wasn't convinced and she traveled a long way to ask the identical question of her grandmomma. </p><p> The old woman thought and thought, trying to remember, and finally she said, "I cut off the butt end because how else would I fit the durn potatoes around it?" </p><p> This journal, then, is my way of getting some of my personal solutions, some new recipes, and passed-on tips to you and still give you room for the potatoes. The blank pages are for you to jot down your own answers to cookin' dilemmas and recipes you've learned and adapted from your momma and want to pass down to your kids. It's also for you to write your own flights of fancy, inventions, frustrations, and victories in the kitchen -- a cookin' diary to look back on and laugh and remember your signature dish that you made every weekend when the kids were little but you haven't made in years. </p><p> I'm hopin' you take pleasure in some of my personal reflections, and, more than anything, I'm also hopin' that you enjoy collaborating with me in your own kitchen. If you really let loose and write down your deepest feelings about cookin' and family and kitchen memories, I'm banking on it that you'll jump on this cookin' journal like a duck on a June bug. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2008 by Paula Deen</p></p><h2>Twigg Stitch: A New Twist on Reversible Knitting</h2><p>Reversible knitting like you&#x2019;ve never seen before! Learn to create totally reversible projects with Vicki Twigg&#x2019;s technique!<br> Hang on to your knitting needles, what you know about reversible knitting is about to totally change! In the beginning, all knitwear designer Vicki Twigg wanted to do was knit a two-colored ribbing without floats.

Vicki&#x2019;s technique, Twigg Stitch, results in a knitted fabric with a different color on each side and allows you to create two completely different fabrics on either side of your project. <br> Unique and fascinating as the technique is, it&#x2019;s not difficult to master; if you have basic knitting skills you&#x2019;ll learn it quickly.

Plus, she provides a stitch dictionary of basic to more complex color patterns, textured patterns, and cables, and shows how to manipulate stitches to create a fabric that resembles lace. <br> To demonstrate this amazing technique, Vicki shares 10 great project that range from simple reversible hats, mitts and scarves to reversible lace shawls.

Blige (American Music Series)</h2><p><p>Mary J. Blige is an icon who represents the political consciousness of hip hop and the historical promise of soul. She is an everywoman, celebrated by Oprah Winfrey and beloved by pop music fans of all ages and races. Blige has sold over fifty million albums, won numerous Grammys, and even played at multiple White House events, as well as the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Displaying astonishing range and versatility, she has recorded everything from Broadway standards to Led Zeppelin anthems and worked with some of popular music's greatest artists&#x2014;Aretha Franklin, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Whitney Houston, Sting, U2, and Beyonc�, among them.</p><p><em>Real Love, No Drama: The Music of Mary J. Blige</em> tells the story of one of the most important artists in pop music history. Danny Alexander follows the whole arc of Blige's career, from her first album, which heralded the birth of "hip hop soul," to her critically praised 2014 album, <em>The London Sessions</em>. He highlights the fact that Blige was part of the historically unprecedented movement of black women onto pop radio and explores how she and other women took control of their careers and used their music to give voice to women's (and men's) everyday struggles and dreams. This book adds immensely to the story of both black women artists and artists rooted in hip hop and pays tribute to a musician who, by expanding her reach and asking tough questions about how music can and should evolve, has proven herself an artistic visionary.</p></p><p>Beginning his career about the same time Mary J. Blige signed her first record deal, music journalist Danny Alexander has worked as an associate editor for Dave Marsh's music newsletter Rock &amp; Rap Confidential and covered rock, hip hop, and soul for various publications. He is the author of Liner Notes: Soul Asylum."Danny Alexander&#x2019;s soulful, beautifully written book unravels the mystery of how a struggling young woman from Yonkers earned a place beside Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, and Aretha Franklin in the pantheon of African American song. Necessary reading for anyone interested in African American music, American culture, or the challenge of being human in a cold and heartless world." (Craig Werner, author of A Change Is Gonna Come: Music, Race &amp; the Soul of America)<br><br>"I&#x2019;ve been waiting for this book for a long time. Real Love, No Drama recognizes Mary J. Blige as one of this era&#x2019;s crucial artists and places her at the center of a profound story about race, gender, class, and American life in recent decades. An expert listener and writer, Danny Alexander has written a sophisticated and deeply soulful book that takes the music, its makers, and its audiences seriously. This is essential reading." (Charles L. Hughes, author of Country Soul: Making Music and Making Race in the American South)<br><br>"Real Love, No Drama is a marvelous telling of Mary J. Blige&#x2019;s story, as well as a reflection of the many years Danny Alexander has spent studying, analyzing, and, above all, enjoying pop music made by female performers. To trace its evolution through Salt&#x2019;n&#x2019;Pepa to Mary J. Blige is a journey not many have had the instinct&#x2014;or the acuity about race, in particular&#x2014;to take. This book shows us the glory and the problems associated with living, for the first time in memory, in a pop world where women are the dominant voices."

But which of his charmingly eccentric neighbors, most of whom have worked in Hollywood since the 1940s, might be responsible for what now appears to be a revenge killing? </p></p><p>Katherine V. Forrest is twice winner of the Lambda Literary Award for best mystery, and has been recently honored with the Pioneer Award from the Lambda Literary Foundation.In this absorbing procedural, Forrest's intelligent, complex series heroine, LAPD homicide detective Kate Delafield, makes her first appearance in hardcover, investigating the Thanksgiving Day murder by strychnine poisoning of septuagenarian Owen Sinclair, a retired movie director. Suspecting a revenge killing, Kate learns that more than 30 years ago, in the '50s, Sinclair named names to the House Un-American Activities Committee, destroying countless careers and lives in Hollywood.

Good Things from Tag Sales and Flea Markets offers valuable advice for entering this world of bargaining and &#34;find&#34; hunting.</p><p></p><h2>Batting Against Castro: Stories</h2><p>With his first collection of stories--some comic, others compassionate, all of them enthralling--Shepard again displays his prodigious writing talent. Ranging from winter-league baseball in pre-revolutionary Cuba to a postapocalyptic frontier in the American South, from the set of Murnau&#39;s classic horror film Nosferatu to more familiar scenes of family life, these 14 stories span an immense fictional landscape with great verve and humanity.</p><p>Jim Shepard's novels include <i>Flights</i> and <i>Kiss of the Wolf</i>. In this, his first short story collection, he skillfully varies his narrative voice and creates ingenious structural forms. In "Mars Attack," the narrator's childhood collection of science-fiction bubble-gum cards serves, as he digs each card out, to stir up painful memories. In "Nosferatu," Shepard invents a putative journal that the German silent film director F.W. Murnau kept during the making of the famous 1922 vampire movie, turning the director himself into a twisted Nosferatu-like figure. The title story is a comic evocation of three farm-league baseball players who travel to Havana in 1951, in search of wine, women, and baseball, only to tangle with a young Fidel Castro.With four fine novels (Kiss of the Wolf, 1994, etc.) to his credit, Shepard seems to be something of a writer's writer--he's rightly admired by critics and his peers, but a wider readership has yet to develop. This first collection of 14 expert tales could easily be the work to gain Shepard greater visibility--it's smart, economical, and each story displays that most elusive quality: integrity. The volume is divided into two sections, one on ``strangers,'' the other on ``family.'' The first group impresses with its wide array of distinctive, convincing voices. In the title story, a former major-league ballplayer takes a job in pre-revolutionary Cuba, where the championship series prefigures the Cold War. Another jock, the narrator of ``Messiah,'' unsparingly describes his maniacal teammate, a female-abusing, violent superstar. A short piece, ``Reach for the Sky,'' unerringly brings to life an animal- shelter worker who thanklessly deals with the erstwhile owners of abandoned dogs; another captures the self-defining lingo of fighter pilots (``Who We Are, What We're Doing''). Other voices Shepard channels include a clueless adolescent girl on a mission to uplift a poor friend (``Spending the Night with the Poor''), and in a memoiristic tale, German director F.W. Murnau during the making of his epochal film Nosferatu. The stories in the family section explore such things as the nature and particulars of growing up ethnic and Catholic, the struggles to communicate within a family, and the painful loss of loved ones. The effect of an Italian grandmother's death is traced in ``Touch of the Dead''; ``Eustace'' is nothing less than a Catholic version of Philip Roth's great story ``Conversion of the Jews'': A parochial schoolboy infuriates nuns with his persistent, troubling questions. And ``Mars Attacks,'' one of several wrenching pieces about brothers, uses a wrangle over that infamous trading-card series to chronicle the difficult relations of two siblings. A virtuoso collection. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She has taught history at the University of Iowa, Boston University, and the University of California at Berkeley, and is now the associate director of the University of California Press. She lives in San Francisco.<b>Preface</b> <p> Abigail Adams was a tiny woman, little more than five feet tall, with dark hair, piercing dark eyes, and a forceful personality that belied her size. Quiet and reserved as a child, she nonetheless displayed a brilliant mind and fierce determination even then. As she matured, these qualities broke through her quiet exterior and she became voluble and outspoken, never afraid to assert her opinions whether in the company of friends, family, or heads of state. </p><p> To the modem observer, she is maddeningly contradictory. on the one hand, she was a fiery revolutionary, denouncing British tyranny in blistering rhetoric. She refused to be intimidated by the specter of British attack, even as she could hear the cannon and see the smoke of nearby battles; she raised four children, managed a farm, and conquered her intense feelings of loneliness and depression while her husband spent years away from her serving in the Continental Congress and negotiating with European powers. Her husband, John, called her a "heroine" for her courage, and indeed she was. Yet after the war she turned into a reactionary; she denounced all opposition to the new federal government as dangerous, blamed all political dissent on "foreign influence," and advocated the suppression of freedom of the press. </p><p> She was just as contradictory in other ways too. She argued for improved legal rights and education for women long before they became popular issues; but she always believed that a woman's place was in the home and, as she got older, became more and more obsessed with "delicacy" and moral purity in women. She professed to hate politics, and yet obviously thrived in her role as a politician's wife. Even in her relationships with her family, she displayed contradictory behavior. She tried to control the lives of everyone around her but instilled in her children a spirit of independence that made them resist -- though not always successfully -- her overwhelming influence. They often showed signs of resenting her interference in their lives, but they were also deeply attached to her. Despite her sometimes overbearing personality, she was a loving and generous woman. Her concern for her family and friends knew no bounds, and they, in turn, loved her unreservedly. </p><p> One may try to explain away the contradictions in Abigail's life by pointing out that she was essentially conservative, that as a feminist she was limited by the constraints of her times, that her professed distaste for politics was mostly talk. There is some truth in all these statements, but they are hardly sufficient to explain Abigail's complex personality. How does one explain a conservative who advocated independence for America and equality for women? </p><p> Abigail herself would not have appreciated having anyone try to force a pattern of consistency on her life. She was the first to admit that she was temperamental and changeable; she also believed that anyone with an independent mind would not ever try to be consistent. And she was nothing if not independent. </p><p> On some things, however, she never wavered. She was, throughout her life, temperamentally and philosophically conservative, despite her outspoken advocacy of the American Revolution. In general, she feared revolution; she valued stability, believed that family and religion were the essential props of social order, and considered inequality a social necessity. But at the same time she abhorred injustice -- whether it was British control of the American colonies, women's subjection to their husbands, the enslavement of black people, or the antiquated laws that kept European peasants from owning their own land. These were all injustices, in her mind, that could be ended without threatening the underlying social order. </p><p> The American colonies rebelled against England, she believed, because their continued subjection to British rule was neither just nor necessary. The formation of a new American government seemed to her a perfect opportunity for ending women's inferior legal status and for abolishing slavery. But she saw no reason to change basic social relationships or to introduce "democracy." People who did advocate such changes, she believed, were guilty of undermining the government and betraying the ideals of the Revolution. </p><p> She approached the issue of women's rights from a similar perspective. She believed that women were the intellectual equals of men and had a right to an education; she hinted that they also had the right to vote. She talked about the "tyranny" of men and compared women's condition to "Egyptian bondage." Yet she also believed that women by nature were fundamentally different from men and were best suited to be housewives and mothers. To her way of thinking, there was nothing inconsistent about those views. Women had a clearly defined role caring for their homes and families, just as men had their role as breadwinners. Families needed both to survive, and families were the cornerstone of society. Better education and legal independence would do nothing to change this situation; indeed, education would only make women better wives and mothers. </p><p> But, as clear as these points seemed to Abigail, the issues she raised about women's rights did potentially undermine their traditional role, a dilemma that she herself could never quite escape. Although she never actually stepped outside her role as wife and mother, she carried it to its limits. She managed all the family property and investments -- including buying land, planning additions to houses and farm buildings, hiring and firing laborers, contracting with tenants, and supervising farm work. Most of these things were accomplished without John's advice and in many cases without his knowledge. She often disagreed with him on the best way to invest their money, and she generally got her way. She also served as John's unofficial, unpaid, but most influential political adviser. </p><p> Abigail often felt uneasy about the extent to which she stepped out of women's traditional sphere. She constantly asked for John's advice about farm matters, usually without any response except his assurances that she managed brilliantly without his help. She admired women who achieved success in fields generally reserved for men, but she expected them to sacrifice some of their femininity as a result. Even more significant, she admired women who were more conventionally feminine than she was. She worried, for example, that she would not live up to Martha Washington's example as First Lady, although by all accounts Abigail was a far more interesting person. She admired in her own daughter those qualities that were most unlike herself: her quiet, demure manner, her selflessness, her delicate beauty. Late in life, when she compared two of her granddaughters who were entering their teens, she praised the one who was feminine and self-effacing while criticizing the other, who was stubborn and contentious, even though she admitted that the second girl was much more like herself as a child. </p><p> Abigail's ambivalence about her position as a woman affected her attitudes about politics too. On the one hand, she always said that she wished John would give up politics so they could return to their quiet rural life; but she clearly loved political debate and the sense of importance that went with being a public figure. John expressed the same conflicting feelings, as he struggled with his ambition for public recognition and his belief that such ambition must be checked. </p><p> For Abigail, however, the conflict was more complex. As a woman, she could not be accused of ambition; it was simply not a female quality. But in fact she was ambitious, almost without knowing it, and she acted out her ambition in the only way that an eighteenth-century woman could: through her husband. In that sense she enjoyed basking in John's reflected glory. But she also valued a traditional home and family life, which was largely denied to her because of John's political career. </p><p> This ambivalence about politics can be understood only in light of her commitment to her family. Abigail was most strongly opposed to John's involvement in politics during the Revolutionary years, when he was away from home for long periods of time. His absences not only disrupted their family life but also excluded her completely from his work. in later years, when they were together and she shared in his work, she complained much less about his attachment to politics. She continued to regret the disruption to her family -- long absences from their children and from friends and relatives at home -- but as long as she and John were together and she felt herself a part of his political career, rather than excluded from it, she did not regret his decisions to remain in politics. The gratification of being involved in public affairs, however indirectly, made up for the personal sacrifices she made. </p><p> Abigail Adams was, in many ways, a prisoner of the times in which she lived, and her views on women's role in society and on politics reflect that fact. She believed that women should have better education and more independence than the attitudes of the time permitted, and she managed to achieve both through her own determination. But she also accepted the social standards that confined women to the home. She enjoyed her role as wife and mother; she was passionately devoted to her husband and children. Sometimes, however, her devotion to her family and her sense of independence came into conflict. She tried to believe the prevailing notion that women were naturally suited to function in the restricted sphere of the home rather than in the world outside. She often prefaced her comments on politics with an apology for meddling in men's business. But the fact remained that she enjoyed being part of the "busy world," as she liked to call it, and did everything she could to keep herself squarely in the midst of it. </p><p> </p>* <p> Abigail was largely self-taught, a fact that shows in her writings. Her handwriting is bold and distinctive but in no way resembles the regular, clear script of an educated man of the eighteen...</p></p><h2>Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book</h2><p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Calvin and Hobbes, Bill Watterson shares his thoughts on cartooning and the creation of the popular &#34;boy and tiger&#34; strip. The book is illustrated throughout with his favourite cartoons.</p><p>Now that Bill Watterson has retired from drawing syndicated cartoons, the only way to get our Calvin and Hobbes fixes is through his book collections. <i>The 10th Anniversary Book</i> is particularly notable, because in addition to getting some of his most wonderful cartoons, we also gain a sense of Watterson as a person. <p> Approximately one-tenth of the book contains essays about matters great and small--from cartooning to life--and stories about the inspiration behind some of his greatest strips. Not surprisingly, Watterson shines through as a being of considerable integrity, and the cartoons gain in depth thanks to his commentary. And, of course, the cartoons in the other 90% of the book are alternately side-splitting hilarious or touching.

Born in Portland, Maine, and educated at Bowdoin College, Longfellow&#x2019;s ambition was always to become a writer; but until mid-life his first profession was the teaching rather than the production of literature, at his alma mater (1829-35) and then at Harvard (1836-54). His teaching career was punctuated by two extended study-tours of Europe, during which Longfellow made himself fluent in all the major Romance and Germanic languages. Thanks to a fortunate marriage and the growing popularity of his work, from his mid-thirties onwards Longfellow, ensconced in a comfortable Cambridge mansion, was able to devote an increasingly large fraction of his energies to the long narrative historical and mythic poems that made him a household word, especially Evangeline (1847), The Song of Hiawatha (1855), The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858), and Tales of a Wayside Inn (1863, 1872, 1873). Versatile as well as prolific, Longfellow also won fame as a writer of short ballads and lyrics, and experimented in the essay, the short story, the novel, and the verse drama. Taken as a whole, Longfellow&#x2019;s writings show a breadth of literary learning, an understanding of western languages and cultures, unmatched by any American writer of his time.<br><br><b>Susan Jeffers</b> is the illustrator of such distinguished picture books as Three Jovial Huntsmen, a Caldecott Honor book; Rachel Field's Hitty; and the ABBY Award-winning Brother Eagle, Sister Sky, which was also a New York Times besteller.

NO OTHER WRITING OR MARKS ON COVERS OR PAGES.</p><p></p><h2>Vanessa Redgrave:: An Autobiography</h2><p>The celebrated and controversial actress shares the story of her career on the stage and in films, life in a distinguished theatrical family, political activism and commitment to social justice, and marriages and love affairs. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>In keeping with celebrity autobiographies, Redgrave offers a tell-all memoir--except that the passions she reveals are for politics, not sex. Theater and film star, daughter and mother of famous actors, Redgrave writes about her life, her craft, and her very controversial politics. But where other actors grow tiresome in describing their love lives, Redgrave does the same in talking about her 20-year affair with the Marxist Trotskyist Workers Revolutionary Party. And instead of spicing her book with nasty comments about fellow artists, she directs her bile toward capitalists, imperialists, neo-Nazis, anti-Semites, and, of course, Zionists. Of all the controversial causes with which Redgrave has been associated, she is best known--and, in some circles, most hated--for her antipathy toward Zionism and support for the Palestinians. Redgrave offers no apologies here for any of her political beliefs, nor does she express any regrets for the many roles, especially in Hollywood and on Broadway, that she has lost because of her activism, particularly on behalf of the Palestinians. Redgrave, who has refused for years to talk to journalists about her politics, uses this book to present her case, and it is as much a treatise as a memoir. The politics often stop the flow of the book, especially when she segues from a fascinating discussion of how she played a certain role to a tedious discourse on such a topic as dialectic materialism--the movie Isadora gives way to the war in Vietnam, Macbeth to her Hollywood lectures on Marxism. Overall, however, Redgrave's sincerity overwhelms both skepticism and boredom. The result is a book that should fascinate anyone who cares about how an artist's inner life illuminates and motivates his or her work. Redgrave's central premise is that she would not have been half the actor she is if she had led a different life. She makes this case so convincingly that the reader is left wanting to go back and see every part she has played--more often than not brilliantly--with the new eye this book provides. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She is a member of the famous Redgrave theater clan (father Michael, mother Rachel, two acting siblings, Lynn and Corin, and her daughter, Natasha Richardson), was married to Tony Richardson, bore Franco Nero a son, pursued a successful acting career and espoused controversial causes. She takes herself extremely seriously, seemingly omitting no detail, which has the curious effect of making her dramatic life feel flat. Born in London in 1937, her earliest memories are of the war and evacuations to the countryside to avoid bombings. The late Michael Redgrave achieved greater stardom in Britain than in the U.S. as both a Shakespearean actor and a film idol. Vanessa, on the other hand, always made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic with her outspoken political views, especially her vociferous support of the Palestinians. She moved back into the cinematic limelight recently with performances in Merchant Ivory films, including Howard's End, but her efforts here to set the record straight politically may have limited appeal for American readers.

A first novel.</p><p><p>C.S. Harris graduated with a degree in Classics before earning a Ph.D. in European history. A scholar of the French Revolution and 19th-century Europe, she has lived in Europe and various far-flung parts of the old British Empire. She now lives in New Orleans with her husband, a retired Army Intelligence Officer, and two daughters.</p>Set in England in 1811, Harris's riveting debut delivers a powerful blend of political intrigue and suspense. When Sebastian Alistair St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, is accused of the rape and murder of actress Rachel York, mistress to various members of Spencer Perceval's wobbly Tory cabinet, Sebastian goes "on the lam," in the words of young Tom, his adopted companion and faithful servant, and must spend frantic days in clever disguises chasing "across London and back." Uncanny powers of sight and hearing help him to identify several suspects, including Hugh Gordon, Rachel's fellow actor and ex-lover; shadowy French �migr� Leo Pierrepoint; and even his own wayward nephew, Bayard Wilcox, who had been stalking the victim for weeks. Also implicated is portrait painter Giorgio Donatelli, for whom Rachel often posed nude, whose current patron, Lord Fairchild, is expected to be the next prime minister. Waiting in the wings to rule over this gathering chaos is dissolute Prince George (aka Prinny), soon to become regent for his incompetent father, George III. Backed by a blurb from Stephanie Barron, this fresh, fast-paced historical is sure to be a hit. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While the Critique of Pure Reason offers the foundation for his theories of knowledge and reality and the manner in which we come to possess ideas about the world, Kant&#39;s Critique of Practical Reason shows how these mental processes are linked--how the mind moves from a formal understanding of reasoning in general to moral reasoning in particular.</p><p>Library of Liberal Arts title.<b>IMMANUEL KANT</b>, born in K�nigsberg, East Prussia (in what is now Kaliningrad, Russia), on April 22, 1724, was reared by parents who were members of the Lutheran sect known as Pietists. Though his upbringing was religious, Kant did not find himself subjected to a dogmatic or doctrinaire home environment. After completing his early education at the Collegium Fridericianum, he entered the University of K�nigsberg in 1740 at the age of sixteen. Though it was originally thought that he would make the ministry his life&#x2019;s pursuit, Kant took the minimum number of required courses in theology and then dedicated himself to philosophy, mathematics, and physical science. During the years between 1746 and 1755 he worked as a private tutor in an effort to support himself through graduate work after the death of his parents left him without financial assistance. Receiving his doctorate in 1755, he taught at the University of K�nigsberg for fifteen years until 1770 when he was finally promoted to Professor of Logic and Metaphysics. Kant held this position until his death on February 12, 1804.&nbsp;<br><br>Among Kant&#x2019;s most important philosophical works are:&nbsp;<i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>&nbsp;(1781),&nbsp;<i>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics&nbsp;</i>(1783),<i>&nbsp;Idea for a Universal History</i>&nbsp;(1784),&nbsp;<i>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals</i>&nbsp;(1785),&nbsp;<i>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</i>&nbsp;(1786),&nbsp;<i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>&nbsp;(1787),&nbsp;<i>Critique of Judgment&nbsp;</i>(1790),&nbsp;<i>Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone</i>&nbsp;(1793),&nbsp;<i>Perpetual Peace</i>&nbsp;(1795),&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics of Ethics&nbsp;</i>(1797), and&nbsp;<i>Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&nbsp;</i>(1798).</p><h2>Medicus: A Novel of the Roman Empire (The Medicus Series, 1)</h2><p><p>Divorced and down on his luck, Gaius Petreius Ruso has made the rash decision to seek his fortune in an inclement outpost of the Roman Empire, namely Britannia. In a moment of weakness, after a straight thirtysix-hour shift at the army hospital, he succumbs to compassion and rescues an injured slave girl, Tilla, from the hands of her abusive owner. <br> Now he has a new problem: a slave who won't talk and can't cook, and drags trouble in her wake. Before he knows it, Ruso is caught in the middle of an investigation into the deaths of prostitutes working out of the local bar.

She is married with two sons and lives in Milton Keynes, England.*Starred Review* Fans of Alexander McCall Smith will delight in this series debut set in Roman-occupied Britain and featuring wry army doctor Gaius Petreius Ruso. Newly divorced and burdened with the debts of his late father, Ruso finds himself in a ramshackle military outpost with miserable weather and minimal supplies. Ruso's new job gets off to a rocky start when he's called upon to examine the corpse of a young woman who drowned. Then, after a long shift of tending to the sick, the cranky but charitable doctor rescues an injured slave girl from her sadistic owner. His good deed earns Ruso unwanted attention from a hospital administrator whose attempts to cover his bald spot are both desperate and hilarious. It also lands the medicus in the middle of an investigation into the deaths of two local barmaids. Through it all, Ruso wonders what has become of his life. Celebrated as a hero a few years before for rescuing Emperor Trajan from an earthquake, he's now sharing a residence with a doctor of questionable morals and a flurry of seemingly indestructible mice. A strong start for Downie, whose series joins those by Lindsay Davis and Stephen Saylor on the ancient Rome beat but adds a bit more humor to the mix of period detail and suspense. <i>Allison Block</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The chakra power animals are the basis for the therapeutic model known as the Personal Totem Pole Process�. The PTPP� is an internationally acclaimed discipline, with practitioners worldwide. It is a unique blend of the theory of active imagination which was developed by Dr. C. G. Jung, the Eastern theoretical orientation which understands the human being as a system of interrelated energies or chakras, and the Native American practice of speaking to and learning from the animals. <p>The PTPP� has had applications in areas other than Psychotherapy. It has been used on a personal basis by individuals interested in their own growth and healing, by Medical practitioners, by those working with children, on vision quests and by artists and writers and other creative individuals in supporting their own creativity </p><p>This classic work is a personal account by Dr. Gallegos of his experiences with his Totem Pole animals and of some of the experiences of his initial clients with theirs. </p><p>The book is a gentle introduction to active imagery and is of special interest to any one who wishes to explore the Personal Totem Pole process, either on an individual level or as a therapeutic tool.</p></p><p>Eligio Stephen Gallegos, Ph.D is the discoverer of the Personal Totem Pole Process�, a unique and deeply healing method of Deep Interactive imagery, popularly known as the "Animal Work".

In an age where anyone with a camera can call him- or herself a photographer, an apparent lack of technique might be mistaken for a lack of artistic sophistication. In this delightful follow-up to Why Your Five-Year-Old Could Not Have Done That, Jackie Higgins offers superb examples to counter that assumption, such as Hiroshi Sugimoto's anachronistic use of a 19th-century large-format camera to produce intentionally fuzzy pictures, and Richard Prince's controversial technique of "re-photographing" photos, which unleashed a barrage of criticism that he was profiting from others' work. From portraits to documentary images and from abstractions to landscapes, the author identifies 100 important images that are emblematic of innovation in modern photography, revealing the frequently complex processes involved in their composition. In so doing, she offers a provocative reminder of what makes a great photograph.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>The Wizard Hunters: Book One of the Fall of Ile-Rien (The Fall of Ile-Rien, Bk. 1)</h2><p><blockquote><p>Reviewers nationwide, as well as fellow artists in the fantasy arena, have already marveled at the astonishing voice and vision of Martha Wells. With this, the first book in an extraordinary new epic trilogy, the Nebula Award&#x2013;nominated author of The Death of the Necromancer and Wheel of the Infinite dazzles as never before -- bringing a stark and breathtaking reality to an imperiled world of magic. . . .</p></blockquote><p>Ile-Rien faces the grim specter of its own imminent demise. Once a fertile and prosperous land, it is now under attack by the Gardier, a mysterious army whose storm-black airships appear from nowhere to strike without warning. Every weapon in the arsenal of Ile-Rien's revered wizards has proven useless -- their magic quickly identified by the enemy and rendered instantly impotent, their conventional arms spontaneously and inexplicably exploded. And the last hope of a magical realm under siege rests within a child's plaything.</p><p>The tiny sphere was created for Tremaine Valiarde's amusement when she was a child of twelve, presented to her by her uncle Arisilde, the greatest of all sorcerers. But the mage -- among the first to identify the impending Gardier threat, along with Tremaine's notorious father, Nicholas, and one of the first to die because of it -- secreted a power within the orb capable of defeating the invaders. And now, years later, it falls to a young woman lacking any magical knowledge and abil-ity to release it.</p><p>Tremaine's initial attempts have disastrous consequences, transporting her to a strange world far removed from anything she has ever experienced or imagined. In this terrible and wondrous place -- where primitive magic cultures lag far behind Ile-Rien's sophisticated sorcery, where noble warriors clash with dark wizards, where starving demons prowl for prey and the Gardier prepare their assaults -- Tremaine must somehow unlock the sphere's powerful secrets . . . before the slow and monstrous awakening of a hideous evil is complete.</p></p><p><p>Martha Wells is the author of five previous novels: <em>The Wizard Hunters,</em> the first book of the Fall of Ile-Rien, <em>The Element of Fire, City of Bones, Wheel of the Infinite,</em> and <em>The Death of the Necromancer,</em> which was nominated for the Nebula Award. She lives in College Station, Texas, with her husband.</p>"It was nine o'clock at night and Tremaine was trying to find a way to kill herself that would bring in a verdict of natural causes in court, when someone banged on the door." So begins Nebula-nominee Wells's entrancing return to the world of The Death of the Necromancer (1998), and if the rest of the book doesn't quite fulfill the promise of that first sentence, it comes very, very close. On Ile-Rien, a world besieged by the mysterious and well-nigh invulnerable Gardier, Tremaine is recruited to help devise a spell that can break through the Gardier airships' impregnable shields. Yet instead of creating a weapon, the spell transports Tremaine and a small band of cohorts to another world with a secret Gardier base, giving them a chance to spy on the enemy of which they know so little. Tremaine makes an engaging and resourceful heroine, if a reluctant one, while her well-drawn fellow adventurers add plenty of human interest. Where the book falters is in the repetitive action, as various characters fall into the hands of the Gardier, then escape, return to rescue comrades left behind or to attack, get recaptured and escape again and again. Wells's ability to keep the reader wondering what will happen next, however, more than compensates for this relatively minor flaw. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eat All Day Diet: Eat 6 Meals A Day and Lose Weight Fast!</h2><p>Millions of people want to lose weight, but lack the willpower to stop eating. This diet has the answer: eat every 3 hours-so you never feel hungry! Instead of skipping meals, or eating unsatisfyingly small ones, dieters get 3 moderate-size meals and 3 nutrient-filled snacks a day, spaced out from breakfast to bedtime. The surprising benefit of the diet is that it speeds up metabolism, so the same calorie count produces less body fat. Scientific studies back up this revolutionary concept, offering statistical proof that the more frequently people eat, the lower their weight and body measurements. Complete with dozens of delicious recipes and varied menus, it&#39;s the most promising new diet idea ever.</p><p>Helen Foster is a writer who specializes in health, beauty and fitness.

A written leadership philosophy, which we call The Leader&#39;s Compass, achieves the same thing on a personal level; it lets people know what you expect, what you value, how you&#39;ll act, and how you&#39;ll measure performance, with the additional benefits of making the workplace less stressful and more productive.

Connect enough of them together properly, though, and you get spontaneous intelligence. Web pundit Steven Johnson explains what we know about this phenomenon with a rare lucidity in <i>Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software</i>. Starting with the weird behavior of the semi-colonial organisms we call slime molds, Johnson details the development of increasingly complex and familiar behavior among simple components: cells, insects, and software developers all find their place in greater schemes.<p> </p><blockquote>Most game players, alas, live on something close to day-trader time, at least when they're in the middle of a game--thinking more about their next move than their next meal, and usually blissfully oblivious to the ten- or twenty-year trajectory of software development. No one wants to play with a toy that's going to be fun after a few decades of tinkering--the toys have to be engaging <i>now</i>, or kids will find other toys.</blockquote><p> Johnson has a knack for explaining complicated and counterintuitive ideas cleverly without stealing the scene. Though we're far from fully understanding how complex behavior manifests from simple units and rules, our awareness that such emergence is possible is guiding research across disciplines. Readers unfamiliar with the sciences of complexity will find <i>Emergence</i> an excellent starting point, while those who were chaotic before it was cool will appreciate its updates and wider scope. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"Emergent behaviour isn't just a fascinating quirk of science: it's the future ...

In FAIREST IN ALL THE LAND, the best names in comics take their turns fleshing out the pasts of the loveliest Fables in existence. For all those wanting to dive into FAIREST or FABLES, this original graphic novel is a fantastic entry point, as well as a great new chapter for those that have been following Bill Willingham's fairy tale epic for years.</p><p>Bill Willingham has been writing, and sometimes drawing, comics for more than twenty years. During that time he's had work published by nearly every comics publisher in the business and he's created many critically acclaimed comic book series, including <i>Elementals, Coventry</i>, PROPOSITION PLAYER and of course the seminal Vertigo series FABLES, as well as its spin-off series FAIREST, JACK OF FABLES and THE LITERALS. His work has been nominated for many awards, including the Eisner, Harvey and Ignatz comic industry awards and the International Horror Guild award. He lives somewhere near a good poker room.Omniscient powers of observation come in pretty handy when there&#x2019;s a serial murderer on the loose, but the Magic Mirror still needs a mobile body to do the bulk of the legwork, and that&#x2019;s where Cinderella&#x2014;a pretty good detective herself&#x2014;comes in. In this stand-alone graphic novel tied to Willingham&#x2019;s monthly comic Fairest, someone is murdering the fairest of them all, and Cinderella takes on the task of hunting down the killer and protecting the rest of the targets. As she traverses the Fables universe, encountering many faces familiar to fans of the long-running series, she&#x2019;s aided by the Magic Mirror and his storage-bound companions as they do their own investigation into the magical implements (and possible murder weapon) missing from the catacombs beneath their room. Each scene is illustrated by a different artist, showcasing a wide range of styles, from painterly portraits to panel-spanning action. Though familiarity with Fables and Fairest would come in handy, Willingham does a great job of telegraphing enough background that this volume can easily stand on its own. --Sarah Hunter</p><h2>House of Suns (Gollancz)</h2><p>A spectacular, large-scale space opera - the ultimate galaxy-spanning adventure</p><p>Alastair Reynolds was born in Barry, South Wales, in 1966.

But now someone has murdered most of them, and the survivors must find those responsible if the race is to survive. Narrator John Lee generally gives a strong narration, except when he encounters a recurring structural problem in the book: The story features an omniscient narrator, but, from time to time, without warning, the narration is taken over by the main female character. At these points, Lee&#39;s voice doesn&#39;t change, making it difficult to follow the shift in point of view. However, when Lee performs the female character&#39;s dialogue, his voice goes up an octave, making those moments easy to follow.

And today, modernism amounts to a form of complicity with colonialism and Eurocentrism. Let us bet on a modernity which, far from absurdly duplicating that of the last century, would be specific to our epoch and would echo its own problematics: an altermodernity whose issues and features this book seeks to sketch out.&#x201d;</p><p>In his most recent essay, Nicolas Bourriaud claims that the time is ripe to reconstruct the modern for the specific context in which we are living. If modernism was a return to the origin of art or of society, to their purification with the aim of rediscovering their essence, then our own century's modernity will be invented, precisely, in opposition to all radicalism, dismissing both the bad solution of re-enrooting in identities as well as the standardization of imaginations decreed by economic globalization. </p><p>To be radicant: it means setting one's roots in motion, staging them in heterogeneous contexts and formats, denying them any value as origins, translating ideas, transcoding images, transplanting behaviors, exchanging rather than imposing. The author extends radicant thought to modes of cultural production, consumption and use. Looking at the world through the prism of art, he sketches a &#x201c;world art criticism&#x201d; in which works are in dialogue with the context in which they are produced.</p><p>&#x201c;And if twenty-first-century culture was invented with those works that set themselves the task of effacing their origin in favor of a multitude of simultaneous or successive enrootings? This process of obliteration is part of the condition of the wanderer, a central figure of our precarious era, who insistently is emerging at the heart of contemporary artistic creation. This figure is accompanied by a domain of forms and by an ethical mode: translation, whose modalities and cardinal role in contemporary culture this book seeks to enumerate.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Nicolas Bourriaud was the co-director of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris and an art advisor for the Victor Pinchuk foundation in Kiev.

This prose enacts the essential motif of the novel: the notion that every 'correction' is also a negation . . . . The remarkable point is the extent to which the ascetic compactness of Bernhard's style turns these abstractions into a sensory presence . . . . [Bernhard's] connections, at once developmental and contrastive, with the great 'Austrian' constellation of Hofmannsthal, Kafka, Musil and Broch become ever clearer."&#x2014;George Steiner, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"<i>Correction</i> is something exceedingly rare among novels of recent years: a paradigm of consciousness and not simply a product . . . . Bernhard has said that 'the art we need is the art of bearing the unbearable,' and his novel joins that small group of literary works which nobly help us to do that."&#x2014;Richard Gilman, <i>The Nation</i><br><br>"It is high time that we keep Bernhard firmly in our mind, as European readers have been doing for many years now."&#x2014;Peter Demetz, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i></p><p><b>Thomas Bernhard</b> (1931-89) grew up in Salzburg and Vienna, where he studied music. In 1957 he began a second career as a playwright, poet, and novelist. He went on to win many of the most prestigious literary prizes of Europe (including the Austrian State Prize, the Bremen and Br�chner prizes, and Le Prix S�guier), became one of the most widely admired writers of his generation, and insisted at his death that none of his works be published in Austria for seventy years, a provision later repealed by his half-brother.Hoeller's Garret<br><br>After a mild pulmonary infection, tended too little and too late, had suddenly turned into a severe pneumonia that took its toll of my entire body and laid me up for at least three months at nearby Wels, which has a hospital renowned in the field of so-called internal medicine, I accepted an invitation from Hoeller, a so-called taxidermist in the Aurach valley, not for the end of October, as the doctors urged, but for early in October, as I insisted, and then went on my own so-called responsibility straight to the Aurach valley and to Hoeller's house, without even a detour to visit my parents in Stocket, straight into the so-called Hoeller garret, to begin sifting and perhaps even arranging the literary remains of my friend, who was also a friend of the taxidermist Hoeller, Roithamer, after Roithamer's suicide, I went to work sifting and sorting the papers he had willed to me, consisting of thousands of slips covered with Roithamer's handwriting plus a bulky manuscript entitled "About Altensam and everything connected with Altensam, with special attention to the Cone." The atmosphere in Hoeller's house was still heavy, most of all with the circumstances of Roithamer's suicide, and seemed from the moment of my arrival favorable to my plan of working on Roithamer's papers there, specifically in Hoeller's garret, sifting and sorting Roithamer's papers and even, as I suddenly decided, simultaneously writing my own account of my work on these papers, as I have here begun to do, aided by having been able to move straight into Hoeller's garret without any reservations on Hoeller's part, even though the house had other suitable accommodations, I deliberately moved into that four-by-five-meter garret Roithamer was always so fond of, which was so ideal, especially in his last years, for his purposes, where I could stay as long as I liked, it was all the same to Hoeller, in this house built by the headstrong Hoeller in defiance of every rule of reason and architecture right here in the Aurach gorge, in the garret which Hoeller had designed and built as if for Roithamer's purposes, where Roithamer, after sixteen years in England with me, had spent the final years of his life almost continuously, and even prior to that he had found it convenient to spend at least his nights in the garret, especially while he was building the Cone for his sister in the Kobemausser forest, all the time the Cone was under construction he no longer slept at home in Altensam but always and only in Hoeller's garret, it was simply in every respect the ideal place for him during those last years when he, Roithamer, never went straight home to Altensam from England, but instead went every time to Hoeller's garret, to fortify himself in its simplicity (Hoeller house) for the complexity ahead (Cone), it would not do to go straight to Altensam from England, where each of us, working separately in his own scientific field, had been living in Cambridge all those years, he had to go straight to Hoeller's garret, if he did not follow this rule which had become a cherished habit, the visit to Altensam was a disaster from the start, so he simply could not let himself go directly from England to Altensam and everything connected with Altensam, whenever he had not made the detour via Hoeller's house, to save time, as he himself admitted, it had been a mistake, so he no longer made the experiment of going to Altensam without first stopping at Hoeller's house, in those last years, he never again went home without first visiting Hoeller and Hoeller's family and Hoeller's house, without first moving into Hoeller's garret, to devote himself for two or three days to such reading as he could do only in Hoeller's garret, of subject matter that was not harmful but helpful to him, books and articles he could read neither in Altensam nor in England, and to thinking and writing what he found possible to think and write neither in England nor in Altensam, here I discovered Hegel, he always said, over and over again, it was here that I really delved into Schopenhauer for the first time, here that I could read, for the first time, Goethe's Elective Affinities and The Sentimental Journey, without distraction and with a clear head, it was here, in Hoeller's garret, that I suddenly gained access to ideas to which my mind had been sealed for decades before I came to this garret, access, he wrote, to the most essential ideas, the most important for me, the most necessary to my life, here in Hoeller's garret, he wrote, everything became possible for me, everything that had always been impossible for me outside Hoeller's garret, such as letting myself be guided by my intellectual inclinations and to develop my natural aptitudes accordingly, and to get on with my work, everywhere else I had always been hindered in developing my aptitudes but in Hoeller's garret I could always develop them most consistently, here everything was congenial to my way of thinking, here .1 could always indulge myself in exploring all my intellectual possibilities, here in Hoeller's garret my head, my mind, my whole constitution were suddenly relieved from all the outside world's oppression, the most incredible things were suddenly no longer incredible, the most impossible (thinking!) no longer impossible. It was in Hoeller's garret that he found the conditions necessary and most favorable to thought, for getting the mechanism of his thought going in the most natural, most undistracted way, all he had to do was to come to Hoeller's garret from wherever he might be, and the mechanism worked. Whenever I was in England, he wrote, no matter how I felt, I was always thinking, if only I could be in Hoener's garret now, always when he had reached a dead end in his thinking and in his feelings, if only I could be in Hoeller's garret now, but on the other hand he realized that settling for good in Hoener's garret was not synonymous with always being able to think freely and without distraction, and that, if he could stay forever in Hoeller's garret, it would mean nothing less than his own total destruction, if I stay in Hoener's garret longer than need be, he wrote, I'll be done for in no time at all, that's the end of me, he thought, which is why he had always stayed in Hoeller's garret for only a definite period of time, how long exactly he could never foresee, but it had to be strictly limited, he must have considered a stay of fourteen to fifteen days in the Hoeller garret ideal, as his notes imply, always just fourteen or fifteen days, every time, on the fourteenth or fifteenth day, according to Hoeller, Roithamer always packed up in a flash and went off to Altensam, though he did not necessarily stay in Altensam for any length of time very often, but only for the shortest possible time, as little time as he could manage, the absolute, inescapable minimum, no more, he had even been known to take up residence in Hoeller's house with every intention of going on to Altensam after fourteen days or so, but instead of going on to Altensam where he was expected, where his arrival had already been announced, after fourteen or fifteen days, he went from Hoeller's place in the Aurach gorge straight back to England, because his stay at Hoeller's place, in the Hoeller ambience, had not only given him enough, but had actually advanced his thinking so much that he did not need to stop at Altensam but could go straight back to England, specifically Cambridge, where he was always both studying and teaching simultaneously and, as he always kept saying, he never exactly knew at any particular moment whether he was studying or teaching because, as he said, when I was teaching, I was in fact basically studying, and when I was studying, I was basically teaching. Actually I too found the atmosphere in Hoeller's house ideal, I immediately made myself at home in the garret which had been Roithamer's garret and will always remain Roithamer's garret, from the very start I had always intended to take notes on my work with Roithamer's papers and on the entire process involved, and I soon understood how perfect for Roithamer's purposes Hoeller's garret was, how he had settled into Hoeller's garret with its view to westward, pitch-dark it was over the raging Aurach, and to northward, also pitch dark, the water steadily and always noisily slapping and crashing against the wet, glistening rock-face, "rehearsing for AItensam in Hoeller's house" as he called those stays in Hoeller's house, specifically Hoeller's garret, stays that quickly succeeded one another in those last years, especially the last three years, when he went five or six times, for four or five months at a time, from England to Altensam, but actually only to Hoeller's garret, obviously attracted to it by Hoeller's work, those meticulous preservations of animals, and in general by all the curious conditions of the place, so intimately bound up with the play of light in the Aurach valley, where every day ran its course simply enough, but nature was always making itself so powerfully felt, a nature mostly in pain, and all the people there, Hoeller's parents and in-laws and his wife and his still school-age children, for whom everything turned on what game had been shot and gutted, what wildfowl shot and gutted, and all the related chores, all the circumstances of life were bound up with their natural surroundings, it became clear to me that Roithamer had found here in the Aurach gorge as he had nowhere else the inspiration for pressing on with his main task, the building of the Cone, that edifice as a work of art, which he had designed for his sister in three years of incessant mental concentration and which he had built in the following three years with the greatest effort, with what he called almost inhuman energy, built it in the very center of the Kobernausser forest. It was in Hoeller's garret, where I had now moved with Roithamer's papers, most of them relating to the building of the Cone, and I regard my work on Roithamer's papers as the ideal occupational therapy for myself after my long illness and also feel it is ideal, it was here that Roithamer had conceived the idea of the Cone and drawn up the basic plans for it, and the fact that even now, some months after Roithamer's death and half a year after his sister's death, his sister for whom he had built the Cone which is already abandoned to natural decay, Hoeller's garret still contains all the plans, all the books and articles, most of them never used but all of them collected by Roithamer in his last years with a view to building the Cone, all those books and articles in every possible language, including languages unknown to him but translated for him by his brother Johann who spoke many languages and in fact had a gift for languages like no other man I ever knew, the translations were also here in Hoener's garret, and I could see at once that there had to be hundreds of them, stacks of translations from Spanish and Portuguese, as I noticed when I entered the garret, hundreds if not thousands of laborious decipherments of probably important considerations for the construction and completion of the Cone by experts unknown to me but probably familiar to him, he hated the word architect, or architecture, he never said architect, or architecture, and when I or someone else said architect, or architecture, he instantly countered by saying that he could not stand hearing the word architect, or architecture, that these two words were nothing but malformations, verbal monstrosities which no thinking man would stoop to, and I never used the words architect, or architecture, in his presence, nor have I used them since, even Hoeller got accustomed to avoiding the words architect or architecture, like Roithamer we resorted to words such as master builder or building or the art of building; that the word B U I L D is one of the most beautiful in the language, we knew ever since Roithamer had spoken about it, in that same garret where I have now installed myself, one dismal rainy evening when we again, as so often, dreaded the onset of another one of those torrential floods that come tearing down the gorge to devastate the whole area sometimes, though this one receded unexpectedly, those floods in the Aurach gorge would do the most extensive damage but they always spared Hoener's house, all up and down the Aurach they did the most extensive damage but Hoener's house, which was built right into the cleft, was spared always, because Hoeller had known exactly what he was doing, everyone was amazed to see the whole Aurach valley buried in mud, ravaged and destroyed while Hoeller's house alone stood unscathed, incredibly, it was on this dismal rainy evening, with all of us living in fear of another such flood about to bemire and ravage everything in its path, though this time it did not happen, when Roithamer revealed to us the beauty of the word building and the beauty of the word build and the beauty of the phrase builder's masterwork. From time to time he would pick out a word like that, a word that had suddenly become luminous with meaning for him, pick out one word from among all those others, any word at all, and elucidate it to anyone, but usually to those of us who often came in the evening to Hoeller's house and always regularly on those weekends when Roithamer returned from England. Once, as I recall, he spent a whole night analyzing for us the word circumstance, the word condition, and the word consistent. It was touching to find all of Roithamer's books and articles and plans and his writing utensils and thinking aids still right there in Hoeller's garret, just as he had left them. Hoeller's garret was where all the ideas and designs for building the Cone had come into being, here all the ideas had originated, all the plans were sketched, all the necessary decisions for building the Cone had been made here, it was from here Roithamer had directed everything.</p><h2>Spectrum 8: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art</h2><p>The latest edition of the only annual anthology of fantasy art includes 250 illustrations spanning the globe and representing artists throughout this exciting genre, including such notables as James Gurney, Anita Kunz, and Jean &#34;Moebius&#34; Giraud.

Tour.</p><p>Terry McMillan's novels feature chatty, catty narrators who have a story they're just busting to tell you. The dominant voice in <i>A Day Late and a Dollar Short</i> is Viola Price, whose asthma just sent her to the ICU. And who came to visit? The Jheri Curl-wearing Cecil, "a bad habit I've had for thirty-eight years, which would make him my husband." Viola doesn't think Cecil's such a catch: "His midlife crisis done lasted about 20 years now," and "to set the record straight, Cecil look like he about four months pregnant." But somebody did catch Cecil--he recently left Viola for "some welfare huzzy" with three kids. And, as we soon find out in Cecil's first-person chapter, Viola has abundant flaws of her own. McMillan deftly sketches the exasperated intimacy of the long and unsuccessfully married.<p> She also has great dish about family dynamics. Have Cecil and Viola's kids got problems! When lovable, luck-free Lewis turns up to visit his mom, he's drunk, broke, and still whining about his ex, Donnetta, who "didn't have as much sense as a Christmas turkey" (though she did have the sense to dump Lewis). Now Lewis consoles himself with his Bobbing Betty doll. "How could somebody with an IQ of 146 be so stupid?" marvels Viola. And that Charlotte! Viola's daughter is "a bossy wench from the word go." (Gee, where could she have gotten that trait?) Charlotte feels like she never got her fair share of attention, having been born 10 months after the eldest daughter, Paris (now the driven mom of a brilliant athlete whose white girlfriend claims she's pregnant). Charlotte took it out on younger Lewis and Janelle, who's been in college 15 years with no degree in sight. </p><p> At first, you'll make ample use of the family charts in the endpapers to figure out who's who, but pretty soon you'll feel right at home with the squabbling, multiply dysfunctional, ultimately loving Price clan. You may agree with Viola: "Some folks got some stuff that can top ours.

The present book is intended to confirm this view. One kind of philosophical puzzlement arises when we have an apparent conflict of intuitions. If we are philosophers, we then try to show that the apparent conflict of intuitions is only an apparent conflict and not a real one. If we fail, we may have to say that what we took to be an apparent conflict of intuitions was in fact a conflict of apparent intuitions, and then we must decide which of the conflicting intuitions is only an apparent intuition. But if we succeed, then both of the intuitions will be preserved. Since there was an apparent conflict, we will have to conclude that the formulation of at least one of the intuitions was defective. And though the formulation may be imbedded in our ordinary language, we will have to say that, strictly and philosophically, a different formulation is to be preferred. But to make it clear that we are not rejecting the intuition we are reformulating, we must show systematically how to interpret the ordinary formulation into the philosophical one. The extent to which we can show this will be one mark our success in dealing with philosophical puzzle. Another will be the extent to which our proposed solution contributes to the solution of still other philosophical puzzles.</p></p><p></p><h2>Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy</h2><p>In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6.</p><p></p><h2>Capitalism Hits the Fan: The Global Economic Meltdown and What to Do About It</h2><p><i>"With unerring coherence and unequaled breadth of knowledge, Rick Wolff offers a rich and much needed corrective to the views of mainstream economists and pundits. It would be difficult to come away from this... with anything but an acute appreciation of what is needed to get us out of this mess."</i><br> <b>--Stanley Aronowitz, Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Urban Education, City University of New York</b> <p></p><p>Capitalism Hits the Fan chronicles one economist's growing alarm and insights as he watched, from 2005 onwards, the economic crisis build, burst, and then dominate world events. The argument here differs sharply from most other explanations offered by politicians, media commentators, and other academics. Step by step, Professor Wolff shows that deep economic structures--the relationship of wages to profits, of workers to boards of directors, and of debts to income--account for the crisis. The great change in the US economy since the 1970s, as employers stopped the historic rise in US workers' real wages, set in motion the events that eventually broke the world economy. The crisis resulted from the post-1970s profit explosion, the debt-driven finance-industry expansion, and the sequential stock market and real estate booms and busts. Bailout interventions by the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury have thrown too little money too late at a problem that requires more than money to solve. </p><p></p><p>As this book shows, we must now ask basic questions about capitalism as a system that has now convulsed the world economy into two great depressions in 75 years (and countless lesser crises, recession, and cycles in between). The book's essays engage the long-overdue public discussion about basic structural changes and systemic alternatives needed not only to fix today's broken economy but to prevent future crises.</p></p><p><b>Richard Wolff</b> has been a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst since 1981. He has been a visiting professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs, at the New School in New York since 2007.

Brilliant and precocious, at age twenty he was both the youngest general in the revolutionary Continental Army, and privy to the Conway cabal to oust Washington from command. He was Benedict Arnold's aide, but the first to reveal Arnold's infamous treachery. By thirty-eight, he was the senior general in the United States army&#x2015;and had turned traitor himself. </p><p>Wilkinson's audacious career as Agent 13 in the Spanish secret service while in command of American forces is all the more remarkable because it was anything but hidden. Though he betrayed America's strategic secrets, sought to keep the new country from expanding beyond the Mississippi, and almost delivered Lewis and Clark's expedition into Spanish hands, four presidents&#x2015;Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison&#x2015;turned a blind eye to his treachery. They gambled that Wilkinson&#x2015;by turns charming and ruthless&#x2015;would never betray the army itself and use it to overthrow our nascent democracy&#x2015;a fate every other democracy in the Western hemisphere endured. The crucial test came in 1806, when at the last minute Wilkinson turned the army against Aaron Burr and foiled his conspiracy to break up the U nion. </p><p>A superb writer and superlative storyteller, Andro Linklater captures with brio Wilkinson's charismatic ability to live a double life in public view.

She was pale and her hair had the gleam of the sea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casually I opened the door and widened my eyes as if I was not expecting visitors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Girl," Ma said. "Take the suitcase. Hurry up."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai-ming stepped inside and paused on the edge of the doormat. When I reached for the suitcase, my hand accidentally touched hers, but she didn&#x2019;t draw back. Instead, her other hand reached out and lightly covered mine. She gazed right at me, with such openness and curiosity that, out of shyness, I closed my eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ai-ming," Ma was saying. "Let me introduce you. This is my Girl."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled away and opened my eyes again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma, taking off her coat, glanced first at me and then at the room. The brown sofa with its three camel-coloured stripes had seen better days, but I had spruced it up with all the flowery pillows and stuffed animals from my bed. I had also turned on the television in order to give this room the appearance of liveliness. Ma nodded vigorously at me. "Girl, greet your aunt."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, it&#x2019;s okay if you call me Ai-ming. Please. I really, mmm, prefer it."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To placate them both, I said, "Hello."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as I suspected, the suitcase was very light. With my free hand, I moved to take Ai-ming&#x2019;s coat, remembering too late she didn&#x2019;t have one. My arm wavered in the air like a question mark. She reached out, grasped my hand and firmly shook it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a question in her eyes. Her hair, pinned back on one side, fell loosely on the other, so that she seemed forever in profile, about to turn towards me. Without letting go of my hand, she manoeuvred her shoes noiselessly off her feet, first one then the other. Pinpoints of rain glimmered on her scarf. Our lives had contracted to such a degree that I could not remember the last time a stranger had entered our home; Ai-ming&#x2019;s presence made everything unfamiliar, as if the walls were crowding a few inches nearer to see her. The previous night, we had, at last, tidied Ba&#x2019;s papers and notebooks, putting them into boxes and stacking the boxes under the kitchen table. Now I found the table&#x2019;s surface deceitfully bare. I freed my hand, saying I would put the suitcase in her bedroom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma showed her around the apartment. I retreated to the sofa and pretended to watch the Weather Channel, which predicted rain for the rest of the week, the rest of 1990, the rest of the century, and even the remainder of all time. Their two voices ran one after the other like cable cars, interrupted now and then by silence. The intensity in the apartment crept inside me, and I had the sensation that the floor was made of paper, that there were words written everywhere I couldn&#x2019;t read, and one unthinking gesture could crumple this whole place down.</p><h2>Movies of the 80s</h2><p>This book&#39;s 140 A-Z entries include synopses, film stills, and production photos.</p><p>J�rgen M�ller has worked as an art critic, a curator, a visiting professor at various universities, and has published extensively on cinema and art history.

Using a common-sense approach to enjoying nature, Arnosky sends Crinkleroot along woodland trails to experience nature's wonders just as one might come upon them: a sparrow in her nest, a feather to be found, animal paths to discover. While obviously enjoying these wonders, Crinkleroot reminds readers of proper dress in the woods, gives tips on avoiding ticks and bee stings, encourages checking brooks to be sure they are free of litter, and instructs young naturalists in recognizing poisonous plants. A page of more detailed tips is included at the end of the book. Watercolor and black ink give depth of color to the full and double-page illustrations. Specific plants and insects have accompanying captions devoted to making their identification simple. The humorous, reassuring character of Crinkleroot presents the necessary precautions to help children safely enjoy the outdoors to the fullest.

With six figures of student loan debt, Elizabeth Greenwood was tempted to find out. So off she sets on a darkly comic foray into the world of death fraud, where for $30,000 a consultant can make you disappear&#x2014;but your suspicious insurance company might hire a private detective to dig up your coffin...only to find it filled with rocks.<br> <br>Greenwood tracks down a British man who staged a kayaking accident and then returned to live in his own house while all his neighbors thought he was dead. She takes a call from Michael Jackson (no, he&#x2019;s not dead&#x2014;or so her new acquaintances would have her believe), stalks message boards for people contemplating pseudocide, and gathers intel on black market morgues in the Philippines, where she may or may not obtain some fraudulent goodies of her own. Along the way, she learns that love is a much less common motive than money, and that making your death look like a drowning virtually guarantees that you&#x2019;ll be caught. (Disappearing while hiking, however, is a way great to go.)<br> <br><i>Playing Dead</i> is a charmingly bizarre investigation in the vein of Jon Ronson and Mary Roach into our all-too-human desire to escape from the lives we lead, and the men and women desperate enough to give up their lives&#x2014;and their families&#x2014;to start again.</p><p>Elizabeth Greenwood teaches creative nonfiction at Columbia University. She is the author of <i>Playing Dead: A Journey Through the World of Death Fraud</i>&nbsp;and <i>Becoming a Yoga Instructor</i>.Playing Dead 1 HOW TO DISAPPEAR<p></p> <br>When Sam Israel III woke up on a hot Monday in June 2008, he had already decided it was a good day to die. He&#x2019;d lost everything. He had lost his job as founder and CEO of the Bayou Hedge Fund Group, his reputation as a guy who could double your money, and his family in an ugly divorce. And more than $450 million of his investors&#x2019; dollars.<br> <br>That day, Sam was supposed to be reporting to Devens Prison in Massachusetts. At his sentencing hearing a few months earlier, he&#x2019;d been handed twenty-two years for financial malfeasance and fraud&#x2014;one of the harshest punishments a white-collar criminal had ever received. His Ponzi scheme was one of the largest to date, until Bernie Madoff&#x2019;s crimes surfaced eight months later. Sam thought he&#x2019;d do three to five, but the judge surprised him with seventeen more than he had expected.<br> <br>Something about Sam Israel rubbed people the wrong way. He always seemed to be smirking. He refused to mimic the narrative of regret and atonement so many scammers adopt, at least after they get busted. Even the feds in court that day were stunned by the severity of Judge Colleen McMahon&#x2019;s decision. As he was being led out of the courtroom, an FBI agent leaned in and whispered to Sam, &#x201c;I have two words for you: Costa Rica.&#x201d;<br> <br>Going on the run hadn&#x2019;t crossed Sam&#x2019;s mind, but the agent&#x2019;s words stuck with him. And since an officer of the court had presented him with the idea, though jokingly, he thought he&#x2019;d been given the green light. By now, Sam understood that things were often not what they seemed. In his mind, his crime had not been typical Wall Street greed or a pyramid scheme. As he understood it, he&#x2019;d been tapped by the Octopus, an international conglomerate that dictated all financial markets. He had entered a world where he believed that a shadow market secretly controlled the Federal Reserve and that he had survived attempts on his life. While others thought he&#x2019;d been a pawn in a long con, Sam now saw the world&#x2019;s power structures as deeply connected and profoundly duplicitous. Messages could be anywhere, and an FBI agent was not the most outlandish emissary.<br> <br>After his sentencing in April 2008, a limousine dropped off Sam with his mother and his girlfriend in the driveway of the house he&#x2019;d been renting since his divorce. They were all in shock. Twenty-two years. He was forty-nine; he might as well have been handed a life sentence. Bright yellow pollen from budding trees blanketed the GMC Envoy truck that he rarely drove&#x2014;it was simply one among his fleet of a half dozen cars. His mother asked Sam what he was going to do. In the neon scrim of pollen dust, he traced the message &#x201c;suicide is painless&#x201d; onto the hood. She told him the joke (which also happens to be the theme song from M*A*S*H), if it was one, was not in any way funny.<br> <br>Costa Rica. Of course! The country was a metaphor for escape. It meant save yourself; don&#x2019;t go down without a fight. And he would heed the advice. But he wouldn&#x2019;t defect south of the border. Inspired by the Robin Williams comedy RV that Sam happened to catch on late-night TV one night around the time of his sentencing, he realized that he&#x2019;d already seen the world, but not much of his own country. Why not hide in plain sight, in a mobile home? In just a few short weeks between his sentencing and surrender date, he cobbled together an exit plan. Disguised in a hat and sunglasses, he bought a laptop at Best Buy in the Palisades Mall. He found an RV for sale on Craigslist, just like the one Williams commandeered in the film, and purchased it from an elderly Long Island couple for $55,000 cash. He told them he was a professional poker player.<br> <br>Sam tapped the former CIA and Mossad connections he had established through the Octopus. They helped him score IDs and a Social Security number in the name of David Klapp, an Iowa man who had died in 2001. He got a parking permit for all five boroughs of New York, a gun permit, a library card, and signed up as a night school student at a local community college. In three days, he had a new identity and the authenticating documents to prove it.<br> <br>He told a friend he had business to take care of at West Point, and needed a ride. He wanted to check out the Bear Mountain Bridge as a place to stage his suicide but knew he needed to avoid photos of his own car being taken at the tollbooth. Sam didn&#x2019;t spot any cameras on the bridge itself, and he noticed that the southern lane was cordoned off, with construction nets hanging beneath. If he could swing it, he could step out over the ledge and fall into the net. He&#x2019;d look like just another disgraced Wall Streeter who would as soon take his own life before paying his debt to society and his investors. No one would miss the man who had lost millions, whose constant smirk reporters&#x2019; cameras had plastered on the nightly news.<br> <br>On that Monday in June, Sam parked the RV at a truck stop off Route 684 in Brewster. He paid Hassan, the twentysomething nephew of one of his Mossad associates, a wad of hundreds to help him stage his death. Hassan would tail the convicted man&#x2019;s truck and wait for him on the other side.<br> <br>Sam had several cars he could&#x2019;ve driven that day, but he took the Envoy because the family rarely used it. It got such little mileage that he&#x2019;d forgotten the prescient suicide note he&#x2019;d written on the hood weeks prior. He parked the truck at a vista point overlooking the Hudson River and then got into Hassan&#x2019;s Nissan. They drove back over the bridge at fifteen miles per hour to make sure that repairmen weren&#x2019;t working on the construction site that day. Sam thought back to the FBI agent&#x2019;s Costa Rica suggestion. He&#x2019;d been given the green light, right? There would be sacrifices. He wouldn&#x2019;t have contact with his family, and he&#x2019;d have to go underground for a few years. The thought of not seeing his kids&#x2014;a boy in junior high and a girl in high school&#x2014;was distressing. Even in the throes of his divorce and legal troubles, they&#x2019;d never spent more than a week apart. But anything was better than rotting in prison.<br> <br>When Hassan dropped him back off at the Envoy, Sam started to obsess over the things he&#x2019;d be leaving behind for the cops to find. His own wallet, IDs, and credit cards were on the passenger seat. He considered writing a real suicide note but decided against it. That&#x2019;d be too cute. Let them figure the fucking thing out, he thought. He opened up the back tailgate and smoked a cigarette. He walked over to Hassan&#x2019;s car. They were both jumpy with nerves.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to be out of my mind,&#x201d; Sam told Hassan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, man,&#x201d; Hassan said, &#x201c;either way, you are dead. So at least now you&#x2019;ll choose your own end. This is crazy, but you may live and be free. You know you&#x2019;re crazy,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;So just do the fucking thing!&#x201d;<br> <br>In that loaded moment, Sam received Hassan&#x2019;s wisdom&#x2014;that he was fucking crazy and to just do the fucking thing&#x2014;as from a divine oracle. He would do it. But he&#x2019;d given Hassan&#x2019;s uncle a contingency plan. Late the night before, they&#x2019;d been drinking Scotch, and Sam said that if things went south&#x2014;if he missed the narrow construction net and plummeted to the Hudson River below&#x2014;Hassan should give $200,000 to Sam&#x2019;s girlfriend and the rest to his son. Sell the RV, but wipe it of any evidence and fingerprints first.<br> <br>He paused, as if waiting for some act of God to intervene, something that would prevent him from slamming the truck door shut and doubling back across the bridge. But nothing happened. So Sam climbed in, alone, and turned on the engine. He reflected on his life as he drove. What had brought him to this point? How the fuck did it come to this, man? He&#x2019;d believed he was a good person, but in the last few years, he&#x2019;d gotten away from himself. He&#x2019;d lied to his investors when he didn&#x2019;t have to. He&#x2019;d gotten divorced, and he had never considered himself the type to end a marriage. He&#x2019;d joined an underworld where secrets ran deep. Nothing was what it seemed.<br> <br>But as he circled the rotary back across the bridge, he smiled. No matter what, he was free already. It didn&#x2019;t matter how much work lay ahead of him, or if he lived another fifty years or fifteen minutes. The decision had been made. Today was a good day to die.<br> <br>He drove up and paid the toll.<br> <br>&#x201c;HIS WHOLE &#x2018;SUICIDE IS painless&#x2019; thing?&#x201d; Frank Ahearn says. &#x201c;What, did he think the feds were going to show up and say, &#x2018;Hmmmm, he wrote a suicide note on his truck, he must have jumped off the bridge! All right, fellas, let&#x2019;s go home!&#x2019; &#x201d; Frank shakes his head wearily. &#x201c;He conforms to a category of a thief with no walk-away plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m talking to Frank Ahearn to get an expert opinion on faking death in general and on Sam Israel in particular. We are sitting in his garment district office in New York City: a converted factory ensconced between a modeling agency and a drag queen costumer. Frank is the coauthor of How to Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish Without a Trace, a manual for those who want to do just that, and he took a special interest in Sam&#x2019;s case, one of the higher-profile instances of pseudocide in recent years. Sam is one of Frank&#x2019;s favorite &#x201c;morons and idiots.&#x201d; He fits a certain death fraud trend that&#x2019;s all too familiar. &#x201c;None of these white-collar criminals plan their exit. They just keep going until it all falls down. If he&#x2019;d thought about his exit plan as smartly as he&#x2019;d thought about his crime, he&#x2019;d be in a lovely locale right now, enjoying his money.&#x201d;<br> <br>Frank knows all about planning the exit. Billing himself as a &#x201c;privacy consultant,&#x201d; Ahearn is the self-proclaimed &#x201c;world&#x2019;s top expert&#x201d; on helping people dissolve their identities, physically and digitally. In other words, he helps people disappear&#x2014;which, he instructed me, is a very different act than helping someone to fake his or her death. Frank is in his fifties and resembles a Hells Angel. The word Freedom is tattooed across his broad shoulders. His speech is prone to Bronx inflection, and he uses profanity in a way that borders on Zen poetry. (&#x201c;Some days, life is a shitty piece of shit.&#x201d;) He doesn&#x2019;t buy politicians&#x2019; platitudes: &#x201c;I think the government blows, in plain English. They&#x2019;re a bunch of lying mothafahkas.&#x201d; And he believes in the right to protect and conceal one&#x2019;s privacy. Though he does not recommend pseudocide, and claims that he never helped any of his clients fake a death, he wrote a chapter in his book on the phenomenon.<br> <br>I sought out Frank because of his peculiar expertise. A question had been plaguing me, one I hadn&#x2019;t yet been able to answer with any satisfaction: Is it possible to fake your death in the twenty-first century, and, if so, what does it really take? Here was someone who had made a business out of obscuring people, so the most dramatic kind of disappearance&#x2014;pseudocide&#x2014;must have crossed his desk. For someone who helps people disappear for a living, Frank works very much out in the open. He has lent his expertise to the New York Times and National Public Radio on famous missing persons cases such as the Boston gangster Whitey Bulger, who evaded capture for sixteen years, and fabled hijacker D. B. Cooper, who in 1971 parachuted out of a Boeing 727 with $200,000 in ransom money and has never been seen since. If Sam were a case study in how not to fake your own death, I hoped that Frank would be my Rosetta stone for how to pull it off.<br> <br>But obtaining an audience with the world-famous privacy consultant proved more difficult than finding him in the first place. I&#x2019;d tried to meet with Frank for over six months before he finally relented. He would cancel at the last minute every time. He bailed on me while I was waiting for him at a Starbucks on a rainy March afternoon, and when I was downstairs from his office in a skuzzy roller-rink-smelling lobby that shares an address with Fabric Czar USA. He simply texted me &#x201c;Sry Cant Today.&#x201d;<br> <br>As with a bad boyfriend, the more Ahearn pushed me away, the more determined I became to win him over. If he was going to play hard to get, I would meet him with equal and opposing resolve. Each time I set out to meet Frank, my well-intentioned friends warned me to be careful. Why the heck would I need to be careful? This guy charges more for his services to disappear people than I make in a year, so I felt pretty confident he wouldn&#x2019;t do me in for free.<br> <br>One steamy summer afternoon, I head out for yet another meeting, steeled for disappointment and prepared to reverse course back home when he cancels. But moments before our appointed time, my phone has yet to buzz and deliver bad news. Even the elevator ride up to meet him feels victorious. I have finally managed to move beyond the lobby. An unmarked white door swings open, and Frank, six foot four, with his hair scraped into a thin ponytail, extends a meaty hand, splotchy blue tattoos coiling up his forearms. &#x201c;How ya doin&#x2019;, hon?&#x201d; he says before leading me through a honeycomb of offices separated by flimsy particleboard. After all his evasions, this is like getting an audience with the Pope.<br> <br>He is warm and engaging, a far cry from the slippery front he&#x2019;d used to stonewall me. I ask him why he&#x2019;d blown me off for so long, and he admits that he thought I was merely posing as a writer and was actually going to serve him papers. He takes precautions with nosy inquirers: &#x201c;If you look me up, you&#x2019;ll find an address in the Bronx for me, which is actually my brother, and if you ring the doorbell, he&#x2019;ll stick a gun in your face.&#x201d; And given the fuzzy area of the law his work occupies, he possesses a healthy skepticism about anyone who contacts him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a cop, a criminal, or crazy until proven otherwise,&#x201d; he says. And he doesn&#x2019;t help criminals.<br> <br>Frank is a god of high bullshit. Not the kind of bullshit that is necessarily lying, but the kind of storytelling that seduces anyone, anywhere. His infinite yarns&#x2014;from growing up on the city&#x2019;s mean streets to scoring criminal records from a pay phone&#x2014;establish an immediate intimacy, as he inserts your name into the million hypothetical scenarios he constructs to illustrate his dark work. Frank tells his story like an origin myth, replete with American up-by-your-bootstraps redemption, self-made entrepreneurship, and the right to individual privacy. And a little bit of bullshit.<br> <br>To my dismay, it turned out that Frank frowns upon death fraud. But only out of pragmatism: he says it simply doesn&#x2019;t work. &#x201c;If your purpose is to defraud an insurance company, there are guys who are paid to check you out,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;Grave robbing&#x2014;finding a kid who died at a young age&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t work today. Twenty years ago, you could walk into the Social Security office and say, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve never worked, but I just got a job, and I need a card,&#x2019; and they would give it to you if you had a fake birth certificate. Death records are now connected to Social Security records, but it didn&#x2019;t used to be like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Eileen Horan, Frank&#x2019;s former employee, ex-fianc�e, and coauthor of How to Disappear, would explain later, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always one factor you can&#x2019;t count on when you fake your death. You&#x2019;re doubling your chances of getting caught.&#x201d; Ahearn echoed her sentiments: &#x201c;Think about any crime. Usually police don&#x2019;t catch them in the act, they catch them for the broken headlight on their car.&#x201d;<br> <br>Which is exactly what happened to Bennie Wint, who had been presumed dead since staging his drowning off the coast of Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1989. He&#x2019;d been involved in a narcotics ring, and, swept up in paranoia, he believed the cops were onto him.

He is currently the director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany, and lectures around the world on the importance of proper risk education for everyone from school-age children to prominent doctors, bankers, and politicians.GUT FEELINGS is a fascinating analysis of how human beings make choices and judgments based on instincts. Author Gerd Gigerenzer explains where these gut feelings come from and talks about the role they play in our decisions about everything from business investments to choosing a mate. The text is peppered with plenty of anecdotes that keep it interesting and relevant. Dick Hill reads these examples with perfect inflection, and he reads the more scientific passages clearly and evenly, making complicated concepts easy to follow. This is a great narration because Hill remains unobtrusive, drawing the listener�s attention to the subject matter rather than his performance. With no apparent effort, he makes this book an entertaining and informative listen.

Light rain stung Dysan's face as he slouched along the Avenue of Temples that led to the shattered ruin he alone called home. The dampness added volume and curl to raven hair already too thick to comb. It fell to his shoulders in a chaotic snarl that he clipped only when it persistently fell into his eyes. Few bothered with this quarter of the city, though Dysan guessed it had once bustled with priests and their pious. In the ten years since Arizak and his Irrune warriors had destroyed the Bloody Hand of Dyareela and banished all but their own religion from the inner regions of Sanctuary, no one had bothered to pick up the desecrated pieces the Dyareelans had left of their former temples. Instead, the buildings fell prey to ten years of disrepair, beset by Sanctuary's infernal storms and soggy climate.At sixteen, Dysan was only just beginning to learn his way around the city that bred, bore, and neglectedto raise him. He recalled only flashes of his first four years, when he, his mother, and his brother, Kharmael, had lived in a hovel near the Street of Red Lanterns. Only in the last few years had he figured out what so many must have known all along: Kharmael's father, Ilmaris, the man Dysan had once blindly believed his own, had died three years before his birth. Their mother had supported them with her body. Dysan's father might be any man who had lived in or passed through Sanctuary, and his mother, in what the Rankans had proclaimed was the 86th year of their crumbling empire and the Ilsigis called the 3,553rd year of theirs.Dysan flicked water from his lashes and wiped his dripping nose with the back of a grimy, tattered sleeve. He had managed to swipe a handful of bread and some lumps of fish from an unwatched stew pot, enough to fill his small belly. Tonight, he planned to use his meager store of wood to light a fire in the Yard--his name for the roofless two-walled main room of his home--beneath an overhang sheltered from the rain. It was a luxury he did not often allow himself. The flames sometimes managed to chase away the chill that had haunted his heart for every one of the ten years he had lived without his brother, but it was a bittersweet trade-off. Even small, controlled fires sometimes stirred flashbacks to the worst moments of his life.Tears rose, unbidden, mingling with the rainwater dribbling down Dysan's face. Kharmael and the Dyareelans had raised him from a toddler to a child in a world of pain and blood that no one should ever have to endure. Lightning flashed, igniting the sky and a memory of a stranger: skinned and mutilated by laughing children trained to kill with cruel and guiltless pleasure. Dysan had personallysuffered the lash of the whip only once. Small and frail, half the size of a normal four-year-old, he had passed out at the agony of the first strike. Only the scars that striped his shoulders and back, and the aches that had assailed him on awakening, made it clear that his lack of mental presence had not ended the torture. The Hand had labeled him as weak, a sure sacrifice to their blood-loving, hermaphrodite god/goddess; and he would have become one in his first few weeks had Kharmael not been there to comfort him, to rally and bully him, when necessary, into moving when he would rather have surrendered to whatever death the Hand pronounced.Kharmael had been the survivor: large, strong, swarthy with health, and handsome with a magnificent shock of strawberry-blond hair inherited from their father. <i>His father</i>, Dysan reminded himself. Dysan had shared nothing with his brother but love and a mother, dead from a disease one of her clients had given her. Later, Dysan discovered, that same illness had afflicted him in the womb, the cause of his poor growth, his delicate health, and the oddities of his mind. Oddities that had proven both curse and blessing. Social conventions and small talk baffled him. He could not count his own digits, yet languages came to him with an eerie golden clarity that the rest of the world lacked. At first, his companions in the Pits, and the Hand alike, believed him hopelessly simple-minded. At five years old, he barely looked three; and only Kharmael could wholly understand his speech. It was the orphans who figured out that Dysan used words from the languages of every man who had come to visit his mother, of every child in the Pits, interchangeably, switching at random. But once the Hand heard ofthis ability, Dysan's life had irrevocably changed.Dysan turned onto the crude path that led to his home, sinking ankle-deep into mud that sucked the last shreds of cloth from his feet. He would have to steal a pair of shoes or boots, or the money to buy them, before colder days set in. Already, the wind turned his damp skin to gooseflesh; his sodden hair and the wet tatters of his clothing felt like ice when they brushed against him. But the thought of shopping sent a shiver through Dysan that transcended cold. No matter how hard he tried, counting padpols confounded him. Most thieves would celebrate the discovery of something large and silver, but he dreaded the day his thieving netted him a horde of soldats or shaboozh. He could never figure out how to change it or spend it, and it would taunt him until some better thief relieved him of the burden.A gruff voice speaking rapid Wrigglie froze Dysan just at the boundary between the dilapidated skeleton of some unused Ilsigi temple and the one he called his own."Frog your sheep-shite arse, I'm done for the day. My froggin' left hand can't see what my froggin' right hand is froggin' doing."An older man snapped back. "Watch your language, boy! There's a lady present."The aforementioned lady spoke next. Unlike the men, clearly Sanctuary natives, she spoke Ilsigi with a musical, Imperial accent. "Don't worry about his language, Mason. I don't understand a word that boy soys."Dysan peeked around the corner. However else being born with the clap had affected him, it had not damaged his eyesight or his ears, at least not when soggy shadows and darkness covered the city, which was most of the time. He spotted three figuresin his Yard, standing around a fresh stack of stone blocks. They had worked quickly. He had seen no sign of them when he left the ruins that morning. <i>Gods-all-be-damned. What in the froggin' hell</i>--? The goosebumps faded as curiosity warmed to anger. <i>That's my home. MY HOME!</i> Dysan's hands balled to fists, but he remained in place. He had seen plenty of fights in his lifetime, enough to know he could barely take on the plump, gray-haired woman, let alone the two strapping men beside her.The mason translated for his apprentice, eliminating the curses, which did not leave much. "He says it's quitting time. We'll finish staging the wall tomorrow, then start mortaring." Mopping his brow, he straightened, then plucked a lantern from the ground."Fine. Fine." The woman glanced at the piled stone from every direction, stroking her strong, Rankan chin as she did so.The fish churned in Dysan's gut, and he thought he might vomit. He swallowed hard, tasting acid, wishing he had not fought the lurching in his stomach. The sour taste reminded him too much of the End. This time, he struggled against the memory, but it surged over him too quickly and with a strength he could never hope to banish. Once again, he found himself in the Pits, surrounded by deadeyed orphans lost to that empty internal world that numbed them to any morality their parents might have managed to drive into their thick skulls before the Dyareelans snatched them. The Hand molded them like clay puppets to fit their own image of normalcy: soulless brutality, bitter mistrust, and blood. Dysan knew that place, an empty hideaway for the mind while the body performed unbearable evil. In time, the orphans either severed that place or escapedinto it. The first left them forever stranded from their consciences, the latter steeped in madness.When the Bloody Hand finally fell, an old man they called the Torch had interviewed each of them separately. Dysan had dodged dark eyes keener than any man that age had a right to and said he wished to remain in the palace with the Hand forever. At the time, he had meant it. His brother was there, and Dysan recalled no other family, no other life. He knew the Hand was evil, that they gleefully sated their goddess with the blood of innocents, that they tore down the orphans with brutal words, torture, and slave labor. Yet, Dysan had suffered far less than the others. Once the priests gave him the organizational skills to tame his runaway talent with languages, he became proficient down to the accent in every tongue they threw at him. He slipped effortlessly from perfect Ilsigi to a melodious and Imperial Rankene to the rapid, broken Wrigglie that was his birthright. They had taught him others as well, most of which they never named and none of which posed much difficulty, written or spoken. They had taught him to steal, to climb, to bend, wrap, and twist his scrawny, underdeveloped body into positions that allowed access into the tiniest cracks and rat holes. They had taken him to houses and temples, to gatherings and inns, where he had only to sip a bowl of goat milk and report the conversations of strangers, who seldom bothered with discretion in front of a young boy. In short, the Hand rewarded him for next to nothing and taught him to survive.Dysan had used those skills to rescue his brother from the solitary confinement into which the Torch had placed him. Together, they had returned to thePits to gather their scant belongings, all the while planning grand futures that six- and nine-year-old brothers could never really hope to attain. There, they found their companions feasting on a bounty of raw horsemeat. Kharmael joined them. Nursing the end of a stomach virus and accustomed to richer foods than his companions, who supplemented their meals with the bony rats they could catch, Dysan refused his share. Worried for his little brother's strength, Kharmael forced a mouthful on him. Many of the orphans had come to prefer their food raw, the bloodier the better; but Dysan's neverstrong stomach could not handle it. He started vomiting almost immediately. By midnight, all of the others had joined him. One by one, he watched them fall into what he thought was peaceful sleep. But, when a jagged agony in his gut awakened him in the night, he found his brother eerily cold beside him.Now, with a desperate surge, Dysan managed to throw off the memories that had assailed him. Again. Slipping into the shadows, he watched the men and woman navigate the mucky pathway to the road, shaking slime from their boots with every step. The woman's features pinched. "We'll need to cobble that. Can't have us swimming through a stinking swamp every time it rains."<i>My mud. My swamp.</i> Dysan remained unmoving, watching the retreating backs and resenting every word. Though he had long cursed that same quagmire, it was a familiar quagmire. It was <i>his</i> quagmire."Always froggin' raining," the apprentice muttered, and the others ignored him. "Shite-for-sure, I can't wait to get out of this cess of a city.""Gravel might be better," the mason started. "Dump a few cartloads of broken ..." His voice andthe figures disappeared into the night, the lantern light visible like a distant star long after they had vanished.Dysan's fists tightened in increments, until his nails bit painful impressions into his palms. Once certain they were not returning, he glided to the piled stones and examined them. Their position told him everything. These strangers planned to rebuild the missing walls, which might have pleased Dysan had it not clearly meant that someone expected to take over his home. <i>More than five froggin' ruins in this froggin' run-down quarter, and they have to pick mine.</i> There were a lot more than five, but that was the highest number Dysan could reliably identify.Seized by sudden rage, Dysan hurled himself against the piled stones. Pain arched through his shoulder, and his head snapped sideways. He slid to the ground rubbing his bruised, abraded skin, feeling like a fool. The mason and his foul-mouthed apprentice had not mortared yet, which meant the wall would come down, even if Dysan had to do it block by heavy block.Dysan set straight to work. It had not taken the men long, but Dysan harbored no illusions that he could work as quickly. Strength had never been his asset. The Hand had made him understand that his frailty, the strange workings and malfunctions of his mind, his notched front teeth and bow-shaped shins were all a god-inflicted curse visited upon his mother for her sins. If the Hand had intended to drive him toward worship, their words had had the opposite effect. Dysan would never throw his support to any deity who punished infants for their parents' wrongdoing. More likely, the priests had intended the insults as a substitute for the "sheep-shitestupid" label they gave to most of the other orphans. They could hardly call Dysan brainless and still expect him to learn the language lessons they bombarded him with for much of the day.Sometimes, in his dreams, Dysan taunted his teachers, driving them to a raw rage they dared not sate with coiled fists, whips, and blades for fear of losing their delicately constitutioned secret weapon. In his dreams, he could triumph where, in real life, he had miserably failed. Then, Dysan had done whatever they asked because he had seen the price others paid for disobedience. He had been desperately, utterly afraid, terrified to the core of his being, dependent on the praise and approval that he received from a brother who, though only three years older, was the only parent figure Dysan had ever known. Certain her undersized, sallow baby with his protuberant belly and persistent river of snot would die, his mother had not even bothered to name him. He had turned two, by the grace of Kharmael, before she dared to invest any attachment in him. By then, the disease had damaged her physically and mentally, and she relied nearly as much on her older son as Dysan did.Dysan examined the stonework from every angle, ideas churning through his mind. Though willing to spend the night dismantling the structure, he sought an easier and faster way. Well-placed and wedged, the gray stone seemed to mock him, a solid testament to another stolen love. He had one possession in this life that he saw as permanent, and no one was going to take it from him without a fight. He examined the base, knowing that it ultimately supported the entire pile. If he could remove a significant piece from the bottom, the whole day's labormight collapse. He had only to find one stone, one low-placed weak point.Anger receded as Dysan focused on the wall, here studying, there wiggling, until he found an essential rock that shifted slightly when he pressed against it. Dysan flexed his fingers, planted them firmly against the rock, and shoved with all his strength. A sheeting sound grated through his hearing, but he felt much less movement than the noise suggested. Not for the first time, he cursed his lack of size. He had stopped growing, in any direction, since he had eaten, albeit lightly, of the poisoned feast and had met more than one seven-year-old who topped him in height and breadth.<i>Damn it!</i> D...</p><h2>A Little Revenge: Benjamin Franklin and His Son</h2><p>Reveals the stormy and vengeful relationship between Ben Franklin and his illegitimate only son, William, who served as royal governor of New Jersey, and presents a new dimension to this great American figure</p><p></p><h2>The Wonder Book of Sex. 1995.

Born in 1935, the eleventh out of as many children, young Liam was a naive and innocent lad of the Old Country. His memories of childhood include bounding over hills, streams, and the occasional mountain, getting lost, and eventually found, and making mischief in the way of a typical Irish boy.<br><br>As an aimless nineteen-year-old, Clancy met a strange and wonderfully energetic lover of music, Ms. Diane Guggenheim, an American heiress. She and a colleague from America had set out to record regional Irish folk music, and their undertaking led them to Carrick-on-Suir in the shadow of Slievenamon, "The Mountain of the Women," where Mammie Clancy had been known to carry a tune or two in her kitchen. Guggenheim fell for young Liam and swept him along on her travels through the British Isles, the American Appalachians, and finally Greenwich Village, the undisputed Mecca for aspiring artists of every ilk in the late 1950s. <br><br>Clancy was in New York to become an actor. But on the side, he played and sang with his brothers, Paddy and Tom, and fellow countryman Tommy Makem, in pubs like the legendary White Horse Tavern. In the heady atmosphere of the Village, Clancy&#x2019;s life was a party filled with music, sex, and McSorley&#x2019;s. His friendships with then-unknown artists such as Bob Dylan, Maya Angelou, Robert Redford, Lenny Bruce, Pete Seeger and Barbra Streisand form the backdrop of the charming adventures of a small-town boy making it big in the biggest of cities. <br><br>In music circles, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem are known as the Beatles of Irish music. The band&#x2019;s music continues to play on jukeboxes in pubs and bars, in living rooms of folk music fans, and in Irish American homes throughout the country. Liam Clancy&#x2019;s lively memoir captures their wild adventures on the road to fame and fortune, and brings to life a man who never lets himself off the hook for his sins, and happily views his success as a blessing.</p><p><b>LIAM CLANCY</b> was a founding member of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, whose records have sold millions of copies over the past forty years. He lives in County Waterford, Ireland, and continues to record and perform in concerts around the world.1<br><br>Not far from my hometown in Ireland there is a mountain called Slievenamon. It is shaped like a beautiful female breast and on its summit sits a cairn of stones, like a nipple. The name Slievenamon comes from the Gaelic, Sliabh na mBan, the mountain of the women. My blood tells me that my origins are there.<br><br>Some say the mountain got its name from the profile it presents when seen from Carrick-on-Suir, the town in which I was born. A more intriguing story tells how the legendary giant, Fionn McCool, would need a new wife each year and, because of his mighty demands, would put all the candidates vying for the job to a test. On a certain day of the year they would all race to the top of Slievenamon and back. The winner, he considered, might have the stamina to cope with his virility for the next year.<br><br>Our town is in the valley of the river Suir at the top of the tide that surges all the way up the estuary from the sea, thirty or so miles to the east. The wooded hills rise up from the river to the south to good farmland that stretches the eight miles or so to the ice-carved Comeragh Mountains. To the north the land rises to a plain that reaches for the beautiful breast of Slievenamon and its foothills, four miles away. The valley to the west is known as the Golden Vale, the land of milk and honey. It is small wonder that wave after wave of invaders wanted to get their hands on this rich land. Just recently, archaeologists have started excavating local tumulus mounds as old as or older than Newgrange, which predates the pyramids of Egypt by some two centuries. Two groups of burial monuments called portal dolmens attest to the fact that humans have settled in this place since the Stone Age. There is something fascinating and humbling, as the Carrick poet Michael Coady dwells on in his writing, about occupying spaces which others have vacated and which we, in turn, will vacate for the next generation. In the nature of things the people of each generation assume, of course, that theirs is the only important one. In time, others will realize that they weren't the first ones here and try, perhaps, to unearth some knowledge of us.<br><br>On the south-facing slope of Slievenamon stand the ruins of a castle or great house of the 1700s with the remnants of walled gardens and old outlying walls with gable shapes of long-gone buildings. These ruins speak to us, as a well-known song about the place does, of the time when Cill Cais, the great house, was full of life and industry, of plenty and hospitality. The song also tells of the Great Lady--an Deigh Bhean, as she was called in the Irish--who held sway over this revered and wondrous place.<br><br>An ait ud 'na g'conaiodh an Deigh Bhean,<br><br>Fuair gradam is meidhir thar mna.<br><br>--"Cill Cais" (old song)<br><br>What shall we do for timber?<br><br>The last of the woods is down.<br><br>Kilcash and the house of its glory<br><br>And the bell of the house is gone,<br><br>The spot where that lady waited<br><br>Who shamed all women for grace<br><br>When earls came sailing to greet her<br><br>And Mass was said in the place.<br><br>--"Kilcash" (translated by Frank O'Connor)<br><br>I learned that song at school as a boy in Carrick-on-Suir. Like all songs of past times, it was peopled with what I thought of as mythical figures, but one day I happened on a scene which brought the myth and the reality together before my very eyes. As my kids and I wandered about the ruins of Kilcash, a man who lived in one of the cottages nearby recognized me as one of the Clancys.<br><br>"You're one of the singers, aren't you? Liam, isn't it? I knew your father, Bob, from the insurance business. He used to call you by the English version of your name, Willie. Well, now, this is good. Do you see the old church down there below the castle? That's been there since the seventh century and inside that church there's a headstone with your name on it--William Clancy. The Board of Works are trying to save what's left of the early church, and the big stones are pulled back from the underground vault." There was a hint of awe in his voice. "They've cleared away decades of debris. If you go down the steps and let yer eyes get used to the dark, you'll see herself stretched out there, an Deigh Bhean, the Great Lady, Lady Iveagh, with two other skeletons: her husband, a Richard Butler I believe he'd be, and the bishop of the time, whose name I can't recall. Their lead coffins were taken by the IRA to make bullets during the Black and Tan War."<br><br>When the three kids and I went down into the chamber of the dead, sure enough, there on the rubble of the vault floor were the bones, red and moldering, of the woman I used to sing about in school. The kids and I gazed a long moment in fascination before beating a retreat back up to daylight.<br><br>As with many ruined churches in Ireland, the graves of what I suppose to be the "important people" are inside the church walls, while the lesser folk have to lie outside in the adjoining graveyard. As we made our way up to the main part of the church, an old man wandering from headstone to toppling headstone said, "There's class distinction everywhere, even in the graveyard." Searching through the gravestones within the ruined walls, trying to decipher the weatherworn names, I came upon the one my friend had referred to. Since it was made from hard slate and leaning away from the worst of the weather, it was easy to make out the names.<br><br>Among them was one that read: Willm Clancy Died May 11, 1735. He had died two hundred years and nearly four months before I was born. I don't believe in reincarnation, at least not like that, but it did make me stop for a moment and wonder.<br><br>Who was he, then? I thought, this namesake of mine. Possibly a brehon lawyer or bard attached to the big house. The Clancys were reputed to be brehon lawyers or bards since medieval times. Lady Iveagh may have been William Clancy's patroness. In my own case it was a wealthy American lady who took me under her patronage and started my career off in the New World. I wanted to know more about the man. Was he a relative? What was life like in his day? I wished he could tell his story, but the grave is a silent place.<br><br>The words of the Greek poet Nikos Kazantzakis came to mind: "When [a man] dies, that aspect of the universe which is his own particular vision and the unique play of his mind also crashes in ruins forever."<br><br>I hear a challenge in that. So I take up the challenge and tell my story for what it's worth.<br><br>Now in my sixties, I live in a house full of joyous activity, a house I'd always dreamed of building in my boyhood, full of family and friends and people I love. But as I start my story, I lie in a hospital bed because my sixtieth birthday party was full of song and food and music and drink. At some point in the night (I learned later it was four in the morning) I saw someone dive into the swimming pool outside, and since it was my birthday, I dressed appropriately, in my birthday suit, and declaimed:<br><br>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br><br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br><br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>With that I plunged into the lung-chilling water. Excess, I'm afraid, has always been one of the little failings of my life.<br><br>With a lung full of pneumonia, the oxygen hissing through my mask and the antibiotics coursing through my veins, I ruminate upon it all. Like the overtures of the operas my father would entertain us with when we were children, snatches of song and story weave in and out through my fever. I feel like Jose Ferrer as the dying Toulouse-Lautrec in the film Moulin Rouge. All the friends and characters and events of my life come flitting by my bed. Back again comes the "smell of the crowd and the roar of the grease paint," the countless nights on countless stages through forty years of acting, singing, and general foolishness.<br><br>In Carnegie Hall a fellow drops his hat from the top balcony to cheers and roars of laughter from the crowd. Tommy Makem shouts up at him, "Aren't you lucky your head isn't in it?"<br><br>The cross-eyed girls in Dundee, front row, center aisle at Caird Hall, every time breaking us up with laughter.<br><br>The little dancer who joined us on the stage of the Opera House in Chicago, blinded by the lights and dancing closer and closer to the edge of the stage before disappearing into the depths of the orchestra pit.<br><br>The great nights when you could do no wrong and the awful nights when, alone onstage, transfixed by thousands of eyes, you're gripped by cold panic and the overwhelming desire to flee.<br><br>Here they come now trooping through the door to say their last farewells, the ones I knew in the real world and those I knew only in the realm of imagination. Come one and all. Come round my bed and in delirium we'll sing a chorus.<br><br>And it's no, nay, never (clap clap clap clap)<br><br>No, nay, never no more (clap clap)<br><br>Will I play the wild rover (clap)<br><br>No, never no more.<br><br>The fire in my head becomes an ember. I drift toward sleep, smiling.<br><br>Life spreads out like rings on a lake from the place where the stone was dropped. The first rings are mother, father, family, house. Then your street, your town, the characters, the smells, sounds, tastes, the first sense of place. The rings widen to the valley, the hills and mountains, then beyond to the sea, the plains, the next town, the city, and on to the big world. They lose their physical qualities then and become rings of the imagination, of philosophy, religion, spirituality, and creativity, until they dissipate on the far shores of the eternal mysteries.<br><br>I think my first memory was of being in a pram outside our door on William Street on a sunny day. I can see the sides of the pram and hear sounds of laughing and fighting coming from inside the door. There is a pipe on the wall beside the pram. Across the street I see a big purple window and, reflected in it, bright houses.

In this edition Marlene offers her unique blend of wit, a sometimes mordant humor, sensitivity and acute observations of the world as she has known and, to some extent, shaped it. By blending the absolutely practical, (see EATING, MILK, MATERNITY BLUES), with her whimsical, poetic and sometimes moving observations, (see HEMINGWAY, RICHARD BURTON, JUDY GARLAND, THE CAMERA), Dietrich creates in yet another field that special magic with which she has held the world enthralled for decades.</p><p></p><h2>Mamotte!

With uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit, he tells the story of his life -- public and private -- and reveals the events that shaped his reluctant candidacy and the decision-making process that led to his first nomination; the unseen dangers of Gorbachev&#39;s first visit to America; startling facts about top-secret meetings involving heads of state; his frustrations with Congress; and his relationships with the members of his Cabinet. Here are the behind-the-scenes details of the great themes and dramatic crises marking Reagan&#39;s eight years in office, from Lebanon to Grenada, from the struggle to achieve arms control to tax reform, and his unprecedented personal diplomacy with major foreign leaders. His narrative is full of new insights and often surprising revelations regarding his innermost feelings about life in the White House, the assassination attempt, his family -- and the enduring love between him and his wife Nancy. An American Life is an inspiring American success story, a brilliant self-portrait, and a compelling and significant work of history.</p><p>Ronald Reagan was the 40th President of the United States of America. He served two terms as President, from 1981 to 1989.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> If I'd gotten the job I wanted at Montgomery Ward, I suppose I would never have left Illinois. </p><p> I've often wondered at how lives are shaped by what seem like small and inconsequential events, how an apparently random turn in the road can lead you a long way from where you intended to go -- and a long way from wherever you expected to go. For me, the first of these turns occurred in the summer of 1932, in the abyss of the Depression. </p><p> They were cheerless, desperate days. I don't think anyone who did not live through the Depression can ever understand how difficult it was. In the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt, "the country was dying by inches." There were millions of people out of work. The unemployment rate across the country was over twenty-six percent. Every day the radio crackled with announcements warning people not to leave home in search of work because, the announcer said, there were no jobs to be found anywhere. There were no jobs, and for many, it seemed as if there was no hope. </p><p> In Dixon, the town in northwestern Illinois where I lived, many families had lost their land to crushing debt; the cement plant that provided many of the jobs had closed; on downtown streets there were perpetual clusters of men huddled outside boarded-up shops. </p><p> I'd been lucky. In the summer of 1932, I'd been able to work a seventh summer as a lifeguard at nearby Lowell Park and had saved enough money to finance a job-hunting trip. I had a new college diploma that summer and a lot of dreams. </p><p> Keeping it secret from my father -- I knew he believed those daily announcements and would have said it was a waste of time for me to leave Dixon in search of a job -- I hitchhiked to Chicago after the swimming season ended with visions of getting a job as a radio announcer. But all I got was rejection: No one wanted an inexperienced kid, especially during the Depression. And so I had hitchhiked back to Dixon in a storm, my dreams all but smothered by this introduction to reality. </p><p> If there was ever a time in my life when my spirits hit bottom, it was probably the day I thumbed my way back to Dixon in the rain, tired, defeated, and broke. </p><p> But when I got home, my dad told me he had some good news: The Montgomery Ward Company had just decided to open a store in Dixon and was looking for someone who had been prominent in local high school sports to manage the sporting goods department. The job paid $12.50 a week. </p><p> Suddenly, I had a new dream -- not one as seductive as my <i>real</i> dream, but one that seemed to be more grounded in reality, and for a time late that summer, nothing in the world was as important to me as managing the sporting goods department of the new Montgomery Ward store. I loved sports; I'd lettered in football in high school and college and loved just about every other sport there was. The job offered me the chance not only to help out my family financially at a time it really needed it, but to get started on a life career. Even during the Depression, Montgomery Ward had a reputation as a steady employer and I knew that if I did well in the sporting goods department, promotions would follow. </p><p> I told my father I'd run the best sporting goods department Montgomery Ward had ever seen, and when I applied for the job with the manager of the store, I told him the same thing, and then waited for his decision. </p><p> His decision several days later was a heartbreaker. He gave the job to a former superstar on our high school basketball team. </p><p><br> I was raised to believe that God has a plan for everyone and that seemingly random twists of fate are all a part of His plan. My mother -- a small woman with auburn hair and a sense of optimism that ran as deep as the cosmos -- told me that everything in life happened for a purpose. She said all things were part of God's Plan, even the most disheartening setbacks, and in the end, everything worked out for the best. If something went wrong, she said, you didn't let it get you down: You stepped away from it, stepped over it, and moved on. Later on, she added, something good will happen and you'll find yourself thinking -- "If I hadn't had that problem back then, then this better thing that <i>did</i> happen wouldn't have happened to me." </p><p> After I lost the job at Montgomery Ward, I left home again in search of work. Although I didn't know it then, I was beginning a journey that would take me a long way from Dixon and fulfill all my dreams and then some. </p><p> My mother, as usual, was right. </p><p><br> I was born February 6, 1911, in a flat above the local bank in Tampico, Illinois. According to family legend, when my father ran up the stairs and looked at his newborn son, he quipped: "He looks like a fat little Dutchman. But who knows, he might grow up to be president some day." </p><p> During my mother's pregnancy, my parents had decided to call me Donald. But after one of her sisters beat her to it and named her son Donald, I became Ronald. </p><p> I never thought "Ronald" was rugged enough for a young red-blooded American boy and as soon as I could, I asked people to call me "Dutch." That was a nickname that grew out of my father's calling me "the Dutchman" whenever he referred to me. </p><p> My delivery, I was told, was a difficult one and my mother was informed that she shouldn't have any more children. So that left four of us -- Jack, Nelle, and my brother, Neil, who had been born two years earlier. </p><p> My dad -- his name was John Edward Reagan but everyone called him Jack -- was destined by God, I think, to be a salesman. </p><p> His forebears had come to America from County Tipperary by way of England during Ireland's potato famine and he was endowed with the gift of blarney and the charm of a leprechaun. No one I ever met could tell a story better than he could. </p><p> He was twenty-nine when I came into his life. Like my mother's, his education had ended after a few years in grade school. He had lost both of his parents to a respiratory illness that people in those days called "consumption" before he was six years old and was brought up by an elderly aunt who raised him a proper Irish Catholic. </p><p> Despite the brevity of his formal schooling, Jack had a lot of what people now call "street smarts." Like a lot of Americans whose roots were on the nineteenth-century frontier, he was restless, always ready to pull up stakes and move on in search of a better life for himself and his family. </p><p> My dad believed passionately in the rights of the individual and the working man, and he was suspicious of established authority, especially the Republican politicians who ran the Illinois state government, which he considered as corrupt as Tammany Hall. </p><p> Among the things he passed on to me were the belief that all men and women, regardless of their color or religion, are created equal and that individuals determine their own destiny; that is, it's largely their own ambition and hard work that determine their fate in life. </p><p> Although I think Jack could have sold anything, his specialty was shoes. A large part of his life Jack pursued a singular dream: He wanted to own a shoe store...not an ordinary shoe shop, but the best, with the largest inventory in Illinois, outside Chicago. </p><p> Nelle Wilson Reagan, my mother, was of Scots-English ancestry. </p><p> She met and fell in love with my father shortly after the turn of the century in one of the tiny farm towns that were planted on the Illinois prairie by pioneers as they moved westward across the continent during the nineteenth century. They were married in Fulton, Illinois, about forty miles from Dixon, in 1904. </p><p> While my father was a cynic and tended to suspect the worst of people, my mother was the opposite. </p><p> She always expected to find the best in people and often did, even among the prisoners at our local jail to whom she frequently brought hot meals. </p><p> I learned from my father the value of hard work and ambition,</p></p><h2>Calligraphy School (Learn as You Go)</h2><p>Provides a step-by-step course in the fundamentals of calligraphy, from basic script and individual letters to complex calligraphic designs, accompanied by special practice projects to help students master the writing techniques. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Fine penmanship may no longer be a required subject in school, but in other ways, it is experiencing a revival.

Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. "<i>The Right Stuff</i>," he explains, "became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero." <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his "characters" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>"Tom Wolfe at his best."<br><i>--The New York Times</i></p><h2>Annual Monstrous Compendium: 001 (ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS 2ND EDITION)</h2><p>Good condition paperback with minimal wear.

Her honors include the NAACP Image Award for Literature in 1998, and the Langston Hughes award for Distinguished Contributions to Arts and Letters in 1996.Grade 7 Up-Hill explains the violence, frustration, and dreams of economic opportunity that led to the African-American migration to the North at the beginning of the 20th century. He describes the sense of pride, responsibility, and rights engendered by participation in World War I and the white resentment that resulted in such violence that James Weldon Johnson "dubbed the summer of 1919 the `Red Summer'" in response to the bloodshed. The author discusses why blacks settled in Harlem and how it became the "Mecca of the New Negro," attracting the likes of Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer, and Claude McKay. Also highlighted are publications such as the National Urban League's Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life, which not only supplied forums for these writers but also attempted to generate income for them and provide a sense of racial identity. Music, theater, and the visual arts are also covered. The book contains aspects of everyday culture, too, such as the role of churches, funeral processions, and rent parties. Numerous quotes from speeches, poems, articles, and other works are included. The volume is a visual feast, packed with contemporary photographs, reproductions, magazine covers, and posters, and enhanced by an interesting graphic design.

Within a year, when young ears sought the latest in rock, there was "Fire and Rain" and "You've Got a Friend," and a new Southern California-fed branch of pop music. James Taylor was its reluctant leader.&nbsp;<br><br>Remarkably, Taylor has survived: his 2015 release,&nbsp;<i>Before This World</i>, edged out Taylor Swift and went to No. 1 on the charts. Today he is in better physical (and probably mental) condition than during the whirlwind era when he influenced music so heavily, the decade when magazines and newspapers printed feverish stories about his gawky hunkiness, his love affair with Joni Mitchell, his glittery marriage to Carly Simon, his endlessly carried-out heroin habit, and sometimes even his music.

Suzanne Toren skillfully portrays the immigrant parents' accents, the chirpy children, and even sings a beautiful ballad. She also convincingly recreates the well-written text and performs a subplot in which a child confronts her conscience most believably. Listeners feel privy to each child's reactions and thoughts as she experiences the often harsh conditions of the city, as well as her warm and loving home life.

The sources of this difficulty are wide ranging, but a quick summary would include at least the following: jargon that is unnecessarily technical; competing and contradictory methodologies; and a failure on the part of Biblical scholarship to demonstrate the direct relevance of its methods to the pastoral life of the Church. As a consequence, biblical scholarship is often opaque at best and distressing at worst to the student and beginning theologian. And because pastors and lay people are trained within this cobweb of methods, they are often functionally unable to draw clear conclusions from most teaching resources. </p> <p></p> <p>Jerry Camery-Hoggatt addresses this problem with several solutions: a return to a conscious affirmation of authorial intention as the beginning place for interpretation; a careful examination of the actual workings of communication; a concept of <i>text </i>to include the assumptions and cultural knowledge upon which the text depends for meaningful communication; an examination of the various academic disciplines with an eye toward correlating their conclusions with the necessary activities of reading; and easily accessible language that makes sense to the beginning student and the lay reader alike. </p> <p></p> <p>Here is a single, accessible volume that explains the basic vocabulary and logic of biblical interpretation, shows how the various methodologies can be fitted together into a seamless interpretive model for exegesis, and then reflects carefully on the implications of that method for the various issues of reading, teaching, reflection, and preaching.</p> <p></p> <p>Through common and practical examples Jerry Camery-Hoggatt teaches students a way of reading the Bible that replicates the activities the biblical authors expected their readers would perform, and he uses a model that is applicable across linguistic boundaries, genres, and various cultural contexts; that is, throughout the human experience of language there exists a common set of mental activities that can be identified and studied, and these are fundamental to reading and interpreting the Bible.</p> <p></p> <p>The prose style is conversational, non-technical, and is intended to be inviting to the beginning student, and refreshing for advanced students and teachers.</p></p><p>Jerry Camery-Hoggatt is Professor of New Testament and Narrative Theology, Vanguard University (Costa Mesa, California).

From fringed chaps and embroidered jeans to silver- spurred boots and ten-gallon Stetsons, Western wear is a uniquely American look that has romanced the entire world. Journalist Holly George-Warren and designer Michelle Freedman, aided by curator James H. Nottage, round up the different styles of this enduring trend in How the West Was Worn, an authoritative yet entertaining look at "glitterbillies," long riders, rodeo girls, and rhinestone cowboys. <p>Accompanying an exhibition at the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, this colorful tribute features archival photos of celebrities as well as collectibles like vintage album covers, mail-order catalogues, and sewing patterns.

Drucker discusses the new paradigms of management -- how they have changed and will continue to change our basic assumptions about the practices and principles of management. Drucker analyzes the new realities of strategy, shows how to be a leader in periods of change, and explains "the New Information Revolution," discussing the information an executive needs and the information an executive owes. He also examines knowledge worker productivity, and shows that changes in the basic attitude of individuals and organizations as well as structural changes in work itself are needed for increased productivity. Finally, Drucker addresses the ultimate challenge of managing yourself while still meeting the demands on the individual during a longer working life and in an ever-changing workplace. </p><p> Incisive, challenging, and mind-stretching, Drucker's new book is forward-looking and forward thinking. It combines the broad knowledge, wide practical experience, profound insight, sharp analysis, and enlightened common sense that are the essence of Drucker's writings, which are continuing international bestsellers and "landmarks of the managerial profession" (<em>Harvard Business Review</em>). </p><p></p><blockquote>"This is not a book of PREDICTIONS, not a book about the FUTURE. The challenges and issues discussed in it are already with us in every one of the developed countries and in most of the emerging ones (e.g., Korea or Turkey). They can already be identified, discussed, analyzed and prescribed for. Some people, someplace are already working on them. But so far very few organizations do, and very few executives. Those who do work on these challenges today, and thus prepare themselves and their institutions for the new challenges, will be the leaders and dominate tomorrow. Those who wait until these challenges have indeed become `hot' issues are likely to fall behind, perhaps never to recover.<br>This book is thus a Call for Action."-- From the Introduction</blockquote></p><p>No single person has influenced the course of business in the 20th century as much as Peter Drucker. He practically invented management as a discipline in the 1950s, elevating it from an ignored, even despised, profession into a necessary institution that "reflects the basic spirit of the modern age." Now, in <i>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</i>, Drucker looks at the profound social and economic changes occurring today and considers how management--not government or free markets--should orient itself to address these new realities.<p> Drucker sees the period we're living in as one of "PROFOUND TRANSITION--and the changes are more radical perhaps than even those that ushered in the 'Second Industrial Revolution' of the middle of the 19th century, or the structural changes triggered by the Great Depression and the Second World War." In the midst of all this change, he contends, there are five social and political certainties that will shape business strategy in the not-too-distant future: the collapsing birthrate in the developed world; shifts in distribution of disposable income; a redefinition of corporate performance; global competitiveness; and the growing incongruence between economic and political reality. Drucker then looks at requirements for leadership ("One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it"), the characteristics of the "new information revolution" (one should focus on the meaning of information, not the technology that collects it), productivity of the knowledge worker (unlike manual workers, knowledge workers must be seen as capital assets, not costs), and finally the responsibilities that knowledge workers must assume in managing themselves and their careers.</p><p> Drucker's writing career spans eight decades and the years have only served to sharpen his insight and perspective in a way that makes most other management texts seem derivative. While <i>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</i> is no quick airplane read, it is a wise and thought-provoking book that will both challenge and inspire the diligent reader. This book is for people who care about their businesses and careers in the information age--CEOs, managers, and knowledge workers. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p>Peter F.

Acclaimed military historian Brent Nosworthy takes on this great controversy and, for the first time in any book, covers the methods of Civil War warfare in their entirety. This work presents the most thorough study of Civil War military practices ever written. With diagrams, photos, and maps throughout, Nosworthy weaves together the story of newly emerging weapons, the resulting changes in military doctrine, and the combatants&#39; experiences as these innovations were applied to the battlefield. Detailing the four-year evolution of warfare from General Irvin McDowell&#39;s first tentative efforts to Lee&#39;s and Grant&#39;s final exertions at Petersburg, the author examines tactical variation due to regional differences and the distinctive circumstances of each campaign: the methods used in the eastern theater versus those in the west; the confused fighting in the wilderness; the &#34;trench&#34; warfare at Vicksburg; and the techniques used in other famous battles, like Gettysburg and Antietam.</p><p>This massive study of Civil War weaponry, tactics and combat practices covers so much so well that it's indispensable; it's also so densely written that even series students of the conflict may find it slow going. The author, a distinguished independent scholar, has written similar studies of the 18th century's wars (The Anatomy of Victory) and Napoleonic ground combat (With Musket, Sword and Cannon), and here, as in those books, is politely revisionist. Civil War generals were not ignoramuses who mindlessly pitted mass infantry formations against rifled muskets, but men who had studied the revolution in both tactics and weaponry in more detail than is usually allowed in conventional Civil War historiography, of which the author has no high opinion. (It also neglects the prewar roots of the ironclad ship, which Nosworthy does not.) The need for a revolution had not been proven in 1861, and the outstanding merit of the book is the way it pulls into a single narrative how that revolution was completed-or in some cases not completed. Competent officers soon learned that the rifle was potent but not invincible, until it became a repeater (which it should have been in the Union Army by 1863) and the riflemen were snug behind field fortifications, supported by rifled artillery. But the smoothbore Napoleon (for Napoleon III, be it noted) saw out the war because of its greater mobility, and the much derided bayonet retained a psychological impact and the cavalry saber a physical one, both at close quarters. With its first-hand accounts, diagrams and all-in-all exhaustive coverage, this volume is an exceptional reference. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Johnny Under Ground (Inspector Henry Tibbett Mystery)</h2><p>Chief Inspector Henry Tibbett of Scotland Yard helps his wife reveal the mystery behind the murder of her old flame.</p><p></p><h2>3024 Dirty Limericks: The Largest Compilation of Original Limericks Ever Published in One Volume</h2><p>3024 Dirty Limericks is a clever collection of erotic limericks, full of the most bawdy and rambunctious verse ever to be collected in one volume.

Celebrated by Henri Cartier-Bresson, his contemporary and a co-founder of Magnum, Larrain&#39;s experimental process yielded images that transformed the fixed nature of the medium. His images have left generations of viewers in awe of the simultaneous serenity and spontaneity that a camera can capture--when placed, that is, in the hands of an artist with such rare meditative passion. &#34;A good image is born from a state of grace,&#34; the artist once explained. &#34;Sergio Larrain,&#34; a selection of more than 200 images, rectifies Larrain&#39;s omission from the canon of significant twentieth-century photographers, and combines his work in Latin America with photographs taken in Europe. Following a creatively fertile period in the 1950s and 60s, Larrain put away his camera and devoted himself to the solitary pursuit of spiritual mysticism, a decision that further contributed to his reputation as a romantic, a &#34;fatal personage,&#34; in the words of Bola�o. Created with the encouragement of Larrain&#39;s family, the book is sumptuously produced, designed by Xavier Barral and edited by Agn�s Sire, who enjoyed a long correspondence with the photographer and has worked with Magnum on preserving his photographic estate.</p><p>Sergio Larrain grew up in Chile, but left at age eighteen to study at the University of California, Berkeley. Upon his return he began taking photographs in the streets of Santiago and Valparaiso; the early purchase of two images by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, reassured him in his chosen profession. Impressed by Henri Cartier-Bresson&#x2019;s photographs, Larrain presented the photographer his work on los abandonados (street children in Santiago) during a trip to Europe. Cartier-Bresson then invited Larrain to join Magnum in 1960; around this time he also began what would become a legendary project on Valparaiso with a text by poet Pablo Neruda. Unsure if he was suited to working for the press, Larrain retreated to the Chilean countryside and dedicated himself to yoga, meditation, and drawing until his death in February 2012.Having been a self-proclaimed Sergio Larrain junkie for long while, I heard about and waited patiently for this book's release date. I wondered if there would be images that haven't been published before.

But since his death in the 1940 crash of a British bomber in Yugoslavia, he has been largely forgotten. <p>With persistence and unusually keen insight, Ralph Barnes reported on Fascism, Communism, Nazism, and the events leading to World War II.

Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister&#39;s place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</p><p>Katniss Everdeen is a survivor. She has to be; she's representing her District, number 12, in the 74th Hunger Games in the Capitol, the heart of Panem, a new land that rose from the ruins of a post-apocalyptic North America. To punish citizens for an early rebellion, the rulers require each district to provide one girl and one boy, 24 in all, to fight like gladiators in a futuristic arena. The event is broadcast like reality TV, and the winner returns with wealth for his or her district. With clear inspiration from Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery" and the Greek tale of Theseus, Collins has created a brilliantly imagined dystopia, where the Capitol is rich and the rest of the country is kept in abject poverty, where the poor battle to the death for the amusement of the rich. Impressive world-building, breathtaking action and clear philosophical concerns make this volume, the beginning of a planned trilogy, as good as The Giver and more exciting. However, poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers - a crying shame.

When he started playing soccer, his only &#x201c;strategy&#x201d; was to get the ball, outrun everyone else to the other end of the field, and score. At first it served him well, but as he advanced through the sport, he learned that it takes much more than one player's speed to make a winning team. Over the course of his career, he worked his way from the Dutch junior leagues all the way to the legendary AC Milan, eventually retiring from the field to be a trainer, then a manager, and finally a commentator. Each step came with its own lessons, and its own unique perspective on the game.

So many fake foods are in our supermarkets, our restaurants, and our kitchen cabinets that it&#x2019;s hard to know what we&#x2019;re eating anymore. In <i>Real Food / Fake Food,</i> award-winning journalist Larry Olmsted convinces us why real food matters and empowers consumers to make smarter choices.<br><br> Olmsted brings readers into the unregulated food industry, revealing the shocking deception that extends from high-end foods like olive oil, wine, and Kobe beef to everyday staples such as coffee, honey, juice, and cheese. It&#x2019;s a massive bait and switch in which counterfeiting is rampant and in which the consumer ultimately pays the price.<br><br> But Olmsted does more than show us what foods to avoid. A bona fide gourmand, he travels to the sources of the real stuff to help us recognize what to look for, eat, and savor: genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy, fresh-caught grouper from Florida, authentic port from Portugal. Real foods that are grown, raised, produced, and prepared with care by masters of their craft. Part cautionary tale, part culinary crusade, <i>Real Food / Fake Food</i> is addictively readable, mouthwateringly enjoyable, and utterly relevant.</p><p><b>&#x201c;Do not take another bite or swallow another sip of anything before reading <i>Real Food / Fake Food.</i>&#x201d;*</b><br><br> &#x201c;It's unnerving that so many people don't know what authentic olive oil or port wine tastes like because they've been undersold on some offshoot knockoff and no one is raising a flag--until now.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Ming Tsai, author, chef, and host of PBS&#x2019;s <i>Simply Ming</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Larry Olmsted&#x2019;s meticulously researched tour de force is chilling for what he uncovers about the food industry.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Dan Dunn, author of <i>American Wino: A Tale of Reds, Whites, and One Man&#x2019;s Blues</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;This is the health equivalent of Ralph Nader's expos� <i>Unsafe at Any Speed.</i> The content blows the doors off the kitchens.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;*Michael Patrick Shiels, author of <i>Invite Yourself to the Party</i></b><br><br><b>Where's the Kobe Beef?: </b>More than 99.9 percent of the so-called Kobe beef sold in this country is Fake.<br><br><b>Parmesan-Gate: </b>Most Parmesan cheese sold in the United States, grated or whole, cheap or expensive, is Fake.<br><br><b>The Restaurant Scam:</b> Restaurants can claim any food is &#x201c;organic&#x201d; or &#x201c;dry aged,&#x201d; &#x201c;heritage breed&#x201d; or &#x201c;wild caught.&#x201d;&nbsp; Even names of farms and types of fish are misrepresented to justify higher prices.<br><br><b>The Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Racket:</b> Though widely considered the healthiest fat, 75 to 80 percent of the extra-virgin olive oil sold in this country is Fake, and some is even dangerous.<br><br><b>The Sushi Fraud: </b>DNA testing was used to compare the fish that menus offered with the actual species brought to the table in New York City sushi restaurants.

L�wy offers a unique exploration of the role of romanticism as one of the key sources of the Marxist critique of capitalist civilization. And he shows how Rosa Luxemburg, Antonio Gramsci, and Walter Benjamin all share an understanding of socialism as the only truly human alternative to the modern forms of exploitation and oppression found in a capitalist society. Similar themes are pursued in the engaging essays on religion, utopia, and other topics.</p><p>Michael L�wy is Research Director in Sociology at the National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris.

Now, in this new novel, Willis explores the timeless themes of emotion and technology, reality and illusion, and the bittersweet place where they intersect to make art. It's the Hollywood of the future, where movie-making has been computerized and live-action films are a thing of the past. It's a Hollywood which Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe are starring together in a remake of "A Star is Born," and if you don't like the ending, you can change it with the stroke of a key.

He'll digitize her face onto any actress's she lies--Ann Miller, Ruby Keeler, even Ginger Rogers.. What Tom doesn't understand is that Alis doesn't want to look like she's dancing. She wants the real thing. And as Tom finds himself seduced by Alis' impossible dream, he begins to learn that even in a world of technological miracles, there are still some things that just can't be faked.<p>"A tour de force...Connie Willis deploys the apparatus of science fiction to illuminate character and relationships, and her writing is fresh, subtle, and deeply moving."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe Is Just Right for Life</h2><p>Cosmic Jackpot is Paul Davies&#x2019;s eagerly awaited return to cosmology, the successor to his critically acclaimed bestseller The Mind of God. Here he tackles all the "big questions," including the biggest of them all: Why does the universe seem so well adapted for life?<br><br>In his characteristically clear and elegant style, Davies shows how recent scientific discoveries point to a perplexing fact: many different aspects of the cosmos, from the properties of the humble carbon atom to the speed of light, seem tailor-made to produce life. A radical new theory says it&#x2019;s because our universe is just one of an infinite number of universes, each one slightly different. Our universe is bio-friendly by accident -- we just happened to win the cosmic jackpot.<br><br>While this "multiverse" theory is compelling, it has bizarre implications, such as the existence of infinite copies of each of us and Matrix-like simulated universes. And it still leaves a lot unexplained. Davies believes there&#x2019;s a more satisfying solution to the problem of existence: the observations we make today could help shape the nature of reality in the remote past. If this is true, then life -- and, ultimately, consciousness -- aren&#x2019;t just incidental byproducts of nature, but central players in the evolution of the universe. <br><br>Whether he&#x2019;s elucidating dark matter or dark energy, M-theory or the multiverse, Davies brings the leading edge of science into sharp focus, provoking us to think about the cosmos and our place within it in new and thrilling ways.</p><p>PAUL DAVIES is an internationally acclaimed physicist, cosmologist, and astrobiologist&nbsp;at Arizona State University.&nbsp;He is the author of more than twenty books, including <i>The Mind of God</i>, <i>About Time</i>, <i>How to Build a Time Machine</i>, and <i>The Goldilocks Enigma</i>.With an articulate blend of science, metaphysics and philosophy&#x2014;and a dash of religion&#x2014;physicist and cosmologist Davies discusses the implications of the fact that the conditions of our universe are "just right" for life to exist: a concept known as the anthropic principle. Had any of the universe's physical laws or constants been just a bit different, life as we know it would have been impossible. In attempting to explain why this is so, Davies summarizes the current state of knowledge in cosmology and provides an accessible introduction to particle physics. He evaluates numerous explanations for the structure of our universe, such as the possibility that ours is but one of an infinite number of "multiverses," and examines the question that inevitably arises in discussing the anthropic principle: does the design of the universe imply the existence of an intelligent designer? Davis's own feeling is that there is likely some sort of still undefined "life principle" in the cosmos but recognizes that this "is something I feel more in my heart than in my head." While there is much of interest, readers of Davies's earlier book <i>The Mind of God </i>will be familiar with a good deal of what is presented. 35 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Apr. 11)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The similar paradox of the eternal perfection of the Word of God, &#34;settled forever in heaven,&#34; yet given in human words through human personalities, has not been so well explained and thought out. We believe that here Dr. Rice has gone further in clearing up this matter than has before been done. The teaching agrees closely with that of Gaussen, Warfield, Harris and Young. Here you will find the truth, witnessed by devoted and learned Bible scholars Charles Feinberg, R. Laird Harris and S. Maxwell Coder, as well as other trusted fundamental scholars, that the Bible was settled in God&#39;s mind in every detail before written down on earth and that God prepared the men who wrote--Isaiah is &#34;a polished shaft,&#34; for example (Isa. 49:2)--and that God even prepared and controlled the environment and character and feeling of the writers so that they wrote down God&#39;s revelation in His inspired words. Here the Bible&#39;s clear claim to being God-breathed, perfect, eternal, is expounded; the greatest Bible expositors and authors on inspiration are quoted, questions are answered, fallacies explained, all with a holy devotion to Christ and to the Bible as the very Word of God. There has been a great need for a scholarly, thoroughly trustworthy exposition of what the Bible claims for its own inerrant, authoritative inspiration recorded in God-breathed words. Here, evangelical faith and scholarship combine with evangelistic warmth and crystal clear, flowing language. This is the documented result of forty-eight years of Bible teaching, preaching and writing, followed by monumental labor to prepare this volume. We believe the book will prove itself an indispensable classic setting the standard for Bible believers for years to come.</p><p></p><h2>Dark Reckoning (Deathlands, 48)</h2><p>In the epic conclusion of The Baronies Trilogy, Ryan Cawdor faces his ultimate confrontation with the evil mastermind who is planning to use a hightech orbiting transformer to incinerate Front Royal.

Now Dan and his neighbors would risk everything on a drive across the Llano. Along the way, two bands of killers would fight over them, the gunslinger Clay Allison would join up with them, and Quanah Parker's Comanches would try to thwart them-in a bold adventure fueled by the courage to face death, the pride to keep going, and the knowledge that now, there was no turning back.</p></p><p><p><b>Ralph Compton</b> stood six-foot-eight without his boots.

He inherited the newly created duchy from his father, and defended and developed its power ruthlessly during his ducal reign (1404-1419). In the process, he allied himself with the English party in France, with whom he was supposed to have made an &#39;infernal pact&#39;, and came to dominate French politics; his manoeuvres led directly to his assassination on the bridge of Montereau in the presence of Charles, dauphin of France, who may have been personally involved. Indeed, the main theme of the book is John the Fearless&#39;s activities in France, which are seen in the light of the continued need to exploit French resources for the benefit of Burgundy. John also continued to build on the administrative and financial structures created by his father, which were the mainstay of the ducal power, and he had to deal with the restlessness of the Flemish towns, only recently made part of the Burgundian state.More than any other Burgundian ruler, it is John&#39;s personality which determines the course of events: violent and unscrupulous, one quality which John the Fearless completely lacked was prudence. He was a masterful opportunist, who acted impulsively with speed and decision, on the spur of the moment. In the end it was one of his own favoured weapons, political assassination, which was turned against him.</p><p>This reissue of Vaughan&#39;s seminal series is welcome indeed. Nothing of this scale has been written before or since...on the Burgundian state.... Erudite but highly readable....

Portable, inexpensive, and durable&#x2015;the new format was an instant success. By the early 1970s, we were voraciously recording music onto blank cassettes: LPs, concerts, tunes from the radio. It allowed us to listen to music in a new way, privately.<br>Artist and musician Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) looks back at the plastic gadget that first let us make our own compilations. Mix Tape shares the treasured works (and the stories behind them) of over 50 dedicated home tapers, including Elizabeth Peyton, DJ Spooky, Jim O&#x2019;Rourke, Allison Anders, and Mike Watt. From the Romantic Tape to the Break-up Tape, the Road Trip Tape to the &#x201c;Indoctrination&#x201d; Tape, the art and text that emerged was of the mix cassette as a new way of resequencing music to make sense of our most stubbornly inexpressible feelings&#x2015;a way of explaining ourselves to someone we love, or to ourselves. <br>&#x201c;Ask any ex of yours from the early &#x2018;90s about the amorous mix tapes you once made, and chances are, Sonic Youth appears somewhere among the track listing.

Born into a minor noble family, Catherine transformed herself into empress of Russia by sheer determination. For thirty-four years, the government, foreign policy, cultural development, and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion, foreign wars, and the tidal wave of political change and violence churned up by the French Revolution. Catherine&#39;s family, friends, ministers, generals, lovers, and enemies-all are here, vividly brought to life. History offers few stories richer than that of Catherine the Great. In this book, an eternally fascinating woman is returned to life.</p><p></p><h2>Pamela</h2><p><p><strong>Based on actual events, <em>Pamela</em> is the story of a young girl who goes to work in a private residence and finds herself pursued by her employer's son, described as a "gentleman of free principles."</strong></p> Unfolding through letters, the novel depicts with much feeling Pamela's struggles to decide how to respond to her would-be seducer and to determine her place in society.<br><br> Samuel Richardson (1689&#x2013;1761), a prominent London printer, is considered by many the father of the English novel, and <em>Pamela</em> the first modern novel. Following its hugely successful publication in 1740, it went on to become one of the most influential books in literary history, setting the course for the novel for the next century and beyond. <em>Pamela</em> reflects changing social roles in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, as a rising middle class offered women more choices and as traditional master-servant relationships underwent change.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

The Baroque base of the majestic tree supports a landscape in which vivid eighteenth-century Neapolitan creche figures reenact the events of Christ's Nativity. Magi, dressed in sumptuous robes, are surrounded by their retainers and animals. Exotic travelers, townspeople, and shepherds throng to Bethlehem to view the Christ Child lying in the manger. Above the infant and the graceful figures of Mary and Joseph, a glory of angels hovers in adoration.<br>The tradition of re-creating the events at the manger became a national passion in eighteenth-century Naples. Leading artists were commissioned to create extravagant panoramas containing hundreds of figures, many shown dressed in current fashion and attending to their trades. They offer a wealth of information about the costumes and customs of the day.<br>Loretta Hines Howard gave her collection of creche figures, including the magnificent group called the Adoration of Angels, to the Metropolitan Museum in 1965. For many years she installed it personally, and now her work is being carried on by her daughter, Linn Howard. Together with Mary Jane Pool, noted author and long-time editor-in-chief of House and Garden magazine, Linn Howard tells about the Neapolitan tradition of creche making, and about the Metropolitan's collection in particular. The authors also provide a fascinating glimpse into the care and conservation of the figures; thumbnail biographies of the artists to whom particular figures can be attributed; a glossary; and the story of how Loretta Hines Howard began her collecting.<br>A special feature of the book is "The Christmas Story," in which the Gospels are illustrated with pictures of the creche.<br>The magnificent photography that makes this book a work of art was created especially for it by Elliott Erwitt, whose work can be found in major galleries and museums around the world.<br>The Angel Tree: A Christmas Celebration is truly a book for the entire family, a joyous retelling of the story of the Nativity.</p><p></p><h2>All for Love</h2><p>A romantic and poignant collection of letters, poems, stories, songs, and folklore, as well as gift suggestions, celebrate the language and art of love</p><p><i>Love is my life, life is my love,<br> Love is my whole felicity, <br> Love is my sweet, sweet is my love, <br> I am in love, and love in me. </i><p> Love is in the air with this lovely, terribly romantic collection by beloved Caldecott Honor artist Tasha Tudor. Tudor gathers "some of the most wonderful and wise observations on love ever written, by some of the world's greatest romantics," including Michael Drayton, who penned the verse above. With poems, songs, stories, letters, love potions and charms, and excerpts from such luminous writers as Edna St. Vincent Millay, William Shakespeare, Emily Bront�, Robert Browning, Chien Wen-ti, Colette, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, <i>All For Love</i> is a celebration of the delicious pain and pleasure of love. Tudor's warm, old-fashioned, full-page watercolors accompany each ode to passion and tenderness. In addition to the literary excerpts, Tudor has included a section on her own family's Valentine's Day traditions, from heart-shaped cake recipes to Martha Stewartesque flowerpot cards to fun, meaningful projects for the whole family. No need to wait for Valentine's Day for this exquisite gem.

But Mom likely didn't imagine the adventure her little girl would have as she rides to her grandmother's house in this sweet picture book. While the bus is taking her down the streets, through a forest and into a pitch-black tunnel, the little girl encounters an assortment of animal characters who enliven her journey, including a goat who offers her a flower from a bouquet, a wolf child with whom she happily shares her cookies and a fox who attempts to pickpocket a beaver. Adding to the fun are lots of running visual gags, such as the changing headlines on the newspaper that hides one passenger's face, a sleeping sloth who mysteriously appears in different seats without ever having woken up and a nervous-looking turtle whose head and arms pop in and out of its shell. <br>The interior of the bus covers each two-page spread, and award-winning author-illustrator Marianne Dubuc uses subtle colors and tiny details to draw in youngsters to the activity happening there. This book offers a potentially multilayered classroom reading experience: there is the terrific main story of the girl's trip, but there are also any number of mini stories playing out at the same time with each of the other characters. It would work beautifully as a jumping-off point for children to do some imaginary storytelling of their own.</p><p>Marianne Dubuc wrote and illustrated In Front of My House, which was nominated for the 2011 Marilyn Baillie Picture Book Award, and The Bus Ride, which received the 2015 TD Canadian Children's Literature Award.

Readers may contact her through her website: www.lindagoodnight.com<br><br>Ashley Robbins clenched her hands together as she sat in a plush velvet chair ten stories up in a Seattle high-rise. The cashier's check to Cooper Masters was in her purse. Rather than mail him the money, Ashley had impulsively decided to deliver it herself.<br><br>People moved about her, in and out of doors, as she thoughtfully watched their actions. Curious glances darted her way. She had never been one to blend into the background. Over the years she'd wondered if it was the striking ash blond hair that attracted attention, or her outrageous choice of clothes. Today, however, since she was meeting Cooper, she'd dressed conservatively. Never shy, she was a hit in the classroom, using techniques that had others shaking their heads in wonder. But no one doubted that she was the most popular teacher at John Knox Christian High School. Cooper had made that possible. No one knew he had loaned her the money to complete her studies. Not even Claudia, her best friend and Cooper's niece.<br><br>Ashley and Cooper were the godparents to John, Claudia's older boy. Being linked to Cooper had pleased Ashley more than her friend suspected. She'd been secretly in love with him since she was sixteen. It amazed her that no one had guessed during those ten years, least of all Cooper.<br><br>"Mr. Masters will see you now," his receptionist informed her.<br><br>Ashley smiled her appreciation and followed the attractive woman through the heavy oak door.<br><br>"Ashley." Cooper stood and strode to the front of his desk. "What a pleasant surprise."<br><br>"Hello, Cooper." He'd changed over the last six months since she'd seen him. Streaks of silver ran through his hair, and tiny lines fanned out from his eyes. But it would take more than years to disguise his strongly marked features. He wasn't a compellingly handsome man, not in the traditional sense, but seeing him again stirred familiar feelings of admiration and appreciation for all he'd done for her.<br><br>"Sit down, please." He indicated a chair not unlike the one she'd recently vacated. "What can I do for you? Any problems?"<br><br>She responded with a slight shake of her head. He had always been generous with her. Deep down, she doubted that there was anything she couldn't ask of this man, although she didn't expect any more favors, and he was probably aware of that.<br><br>"Everything's fine." She didn't meet his eyes as she opened the clasp of her purse and took out the check. "I wanted to personally give you this." Extending her arm, she handed him the check. "I owe you so much, it seemed almost rude to put it in the mail." The satisfaction of paying off the loan was secondary to the opportunity of seeing Cooper again. If she'd been honest with herself, she would have admitted she was hungry for the sight of him. After all these months she'd been looking for an excuse.<br><br>He glanced at the check and seemed to notice the amount. Two dark brows arched with surprise. "This satisfies the loan," he said thoughtfully. Half turning, he placed the check in the center of the large wooden desk. "Your mother tells me you've taken a second job?" The intonation in his voice made the statement a question.<br><br>"You see her more often than I do," she said in an attempt to evade the question. Her mother had been the Masters' cook and housekeeper from the time Ashley was a child.<br><br>He regarded her steadily, and although she could read no emotion in his eyes, she felt his irritation. "Was it necessary to pay this off as quickly as possible?"<br><br>"Fast? I've owed you this money for over four years." She laughed lightly. Someone had once told her that her laugh was one of the most appealing things about her. Sweet, gentle, melodic. She chanced a look at Cooper, whose cool dark eyes revealed nothing.<br><br>"I didn't care if you ever paid me back. I certainly didn't expect you'd half kill yourself to return it."<br><br>The displeasure in his voice surprised her. Taken aback, she watched as he stalked to the far corner of the office, putting as much distance between them as possible. Was it pride that had driven her to pay him back as quickly as possible? Maybe, but she doubted it. The loan to finish her schooling had been the answer to long, difficult prayers. From the time she'd been accepted into the University of Washington, she had attended on faith. Faith that God would supply the money for books and tuition. Faith that if God wanted her to obtain her teaching degree, then He would meet her needs. And He had. In the beginning things had worked well. She roomed with Claudia and managed two part-time jobs. But when Claudia and Seth got married, she was forced to find other accommodations, which quickly drained her funds. Cooper's offer had been completely unexpected. The loan had come at a time when she'd been hopeless and had been preparing to withdraw from classes. They'd never discussed terms, but surely he'd known she intended to repay him.<br><br>A tentative smile brushed her lips. She'd thought he would be pleased. His reaction amazed her. She attempted to keep her voice level as she assured him, "It was the honorable thing to do."<br><br>"But it wasn't necessary," he answered, turning back to her.<br><br>Again she experienced the familiar twinge of awareness that only Cooper Masters was capable of stirring within her.<br><br>"It was for me," she countered quickly.<br><br>"It wasn't necessary," he repeated in a flat tone.<br><br>Ashley released a slow breath. "We could go on like this all day. I didn't mean to offend you, I only came here today because I wanted to show my appreciation."<br><br>He stared back at her, then slowly nodded. "I understand."<br><br>Silence stretched between them.<br><br>"Have you heard from Claudia and Seth?" he asked after a while.<br><br>Ashley smiled. They had so little in common that whenever they were together that the conversation invariably centered around Claudia and their godson. "The last I heard she said something about coming down for Christmas."<br><br>"I hope they do." His intercom buzzed, and he leaned over and pressed a button on the phone. "Yes, Gloria?"<br><br>"Mr. Benson is here."<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Taking her cue, Ashley stood. "I won't keep you." Her fingers brushed her wool skirt. She'd been hoping he would notice the new outfit and comment. He hadn't. "Thank you again. I guess you know that I wouldn't have been able to finish school without your help."<br><br>"I was wondering..." Cooper moved to her side, his look slightly uneasy, as if he was unsure of himself. "I mean, I can understand if you'd rather not."<br><br>"Rather not what?" She couldn't remember him ever acting with anything but supreme confidence. In control of himself and every situation.<br><br>"Have dinner with me. A small celebration for paying off the loan."<br><br>"I'd like that very much. Anytime." Her heart soared at the suggestion; she wasn't sure how she managed to keep her voice level.<br><br>"Tonight at seven?"<br><br>"Wonderful. Should I wear something...formal?" It wouldn't hurt to ask, and he hadn't mentioned where he intended they dine.<br><br>"Dress comfortably."<br><br>"Great."<br><br>An hour later Ashley's heart still refused to beat at a normal pace. This was the first time Cooper had asked her out or given any indication he would like to see her socially. The man was difficult to understand, always had been. Even Claudia didn't fully know him; she saw him as dignified, predictable and overly concerned with respectability. In some ways he was, but through the years Ashley had seen past that facade. He might be refined, and sometimes overly proper, but he was a man who'd been forced to take on heavy responsibility at an early age. There had been little time for fun or frivolity in his life. Ashley wanted to be the one to change that. She loved him. Her mother claimed that opposites attract, and after meeting Cooper, Ashley had never doubted the truth of that statement.<br><br>Ashley chose to wear her finest designer jeans, knowing she looked good. At five foot nine, she was all legs. Her pink sweatshirt contained a starburst of sequins that extended to the ends of the full length sleeves. Her hair was styled in a casual perm, and soft curls reached her shoulders. Her perfume was a fragrance Cooper had given her the previous Christmas. Although not imaginative, the gift had pleased her immeasurably, even though he hadn't given it to her personally, but to her mother, who'd passed it on. When she'd phoned to thank him, his response had been clipped and vaguely ill-at-ease. Politely, he'd assured her that it was his duty, since they were John's godparents. He'd also told her he'd sent the same fragrance to Claudia. Ashley had hung up the phone feeling deflated. The next time she'd seen him had been in June, when her mother had gone to the hospital for surgery. Cooper had come for a visit at the same time Ashley had arrived. Standing on opposite sides of the bed, her sleeping mother between them, Ashley had hungrily drunk in the sight of him. Their short conversation had been carried on in hushed tones, and after a while they hadn't spoken at all. Afterward he'd had coffee out of a machine, and she'd sipped fruit juice as they sat talking in the waiting area at the end of the corridor. She hadn't seen him again until today.<br><br>Over the months she had dated several men, and she'd recently been seeing Dennis Webb, another teacher, on a steady basis. But no one had ever attracted her the way Cooper did. Whenever a pensive mood overtook her, she recognized how pointless that attraction was. Whole universes stretched between them, both social and economic. For Ashley, loving Cooper Masters was as impossible as understanding income tax forms.<br><br>The doorbell chimed precisely at seven. Claudia had claimed that she could set her watch by Cooper. If he said seven, he would arrive exactly at seven.<br><br>A sense of panic filled Ashley as she glanced at her wristwatch. It couldn't possibly be that time already, could it? With one red cowboy boot on and the other lying on the carpet, she looked around frantically. The laundry still hadn't been put away. Quickly she hobbled across the floor and shoved the basket full of folded clean clothes into the entryway closet, then closed the door with her back as she conducted a sweeping inspection of the apartment. Expelling a calming sigh, she forced herself to smile casually as she opened the door.<br><br>He greeted her with a warm look, that gradually faded as he handed her a florist's box.<br><br>To Cooper, apparently informal meant a three-piece suit and flowers. Glancing down at her jeans and sweatshirt, one cowboy boot on, the other missing, she smiled weakly and felt wretched. "Thank you." She took the small white box. "Sit down, please." Hurrying ahead of him, she fluffed up the pillows at the end of the sofa, then hugged one to her stomach. "I'm running a little late tonight. If you'll give me a few minutes I'll change clothes."<br><br>"You look fine just the way you are," he murmured, glancing at his watch.<br><br>What he was really saying, she realized, was that they would be late for their reservation if she took the time to change clothes. After glancing down at the hot pink sweatshirt, she raised her gaze to meet his. "You're sure? It'll only take a minute."<br><br>His nod seemed determined. Self-conscious, embarrassed and angry with herself, Ashley sat at the opposite end of the sofa and slipped her foot into the other boot. After tucking in her denim pant leg, she sat up and reached for the florist's box. A lovely white orchid was nestled in a bed of sheer green paper. A gasp of pleasure escaped her.<br><br>"Oh, Cooper," she murmured, feeling close to tears. No one had ever given her an orchid. "Thank you."<br><br>"Since I didn't know the color of your dress..." He paused to correct himself. "...your outfit...this seemed appropriate." He remained standing, studying her. "It's the type women wear on their wrist."<br><br>As Ashley lifted the orchid from the box, its gentle fragrance drifted pleasantly to her. "I'm always having to thank you, Cooper. You've been very good to me."<br><br>He dismissed her appreciation with a hard shake of his head. "Nonsense."<br><br>She knew that further discussion would only embarrass them both. Standing, she glanced at the closet door, knowing nothing would induce her to open it and expose her folded underwear to Cooper. "I'll get my purse and we can go."<br><br>"You might want to wear a coat," he suggested. "I heard something about the possibility of snow over the radio this afternoon."<br><br>"Yes, of course." If he remained standing exactly as he was, she might be able to open the door just enough to slip her hand in and jerk her faux fur jacket off the hanger. Somehow she managed it. Turning, she noted that Cooper was regarding her curiously. Rather than fabricate a wild excuse about why she couldn't open the closet all the way, she decided to say nothing.<br><br>He took the coat from her grasp, holding it open for her to slip her arms into the sleeves. It seemed as if his hands lingered longer than necessary on her shoulders, but it could have been her imagination. He had never been one to display affection openly.<br><br>"Where are we going?" she asked, and her voice trembled slightly, affected by even the most impersonal touch.<br><br>"I chose an Italian restaurant not far from here. I hope that suits you."<br><br>"Sounds delicious. I love Italian food." Her tastes in food were wide and varied, but it wouldn't have mattered. If he had suggested hot dogs, she would have been thrilled. The idea of Cooper eating anything with his fingers produced a quivering smile. If he noticed it, he said nothing.<br><br>Cooper parked outside the small, family-owned restaurant and came around to her side of the car, opening the door for her. It was apparent when they were seated that he had never been there before. The thought flashed through her mind that he didn't want to be seen with her where he might be recognized.<br><br>But she quickly dismissed the idea. If he didn't want to be with her, then he wouldn't have asked her out. Those thoughts were unworthy of Cooper, who had always been good to her.<br><br>"Is everything all right?" As he stared across the table at her, a frown drew his brows together.<br><br>"Yes, of course." She looked down at her menu, guiltily forcing a smile on her face. "I wonder how long it'll be before we know if Claudia will be coming for Christmas," she said, hoping to resume the even flow of conversation.<br><br>"Time's getting close. I imagine we'll know soon."<br><br>Thanksgiving was the following weekend, but Christmas displays were already up in stores; some had shown up as early as Halloween. Doubtless Seth and Claudia would let them know by the end of next week. The prospect of sharing the holiday with her friend&#x2014;and therefore Cooper&#x2014;produced a glow of happiness inside Ashley.<br><br>The waiter took their order, then promptly delivered their fresh green salads.<br><br>"It's been exceptionally chilly for this time of the year," Cooper commented, lifting his fork, his gaze centered on his plate.<br><br>Ashley thought it was a sad commentary that their only common ground consisted of Claudia and the weather. "Yes, it has." She looked up to note that a veiled look had come over his features. Perhaps he was thinking the same thing.<br><br></p><h2>Book of Trout Flies</h2><p>The classic and pioneering book on the identification and imitation of trout-stream insects.</p><p></p><h2>Native Tongue</h2><p>With the passage of the twenty-fifth amendment, which denies women equal rights, a cold war between the sexes ensues for several hundred years in a world that relies on interplanetary trade.

Knives and Chromosomes <br><br>Bertie Pollock (6) was the son of Irene Pollock (37) and Stuart Pollock (40), and older brother of Ulysses Colquhoun Pollock (1). Ulysses was also the son of Irene but possibly not of Stuart, the small boy bearing a remarkable resemblance to Bertie&#x2019;s psychotherapist, recently self-removed from Edinburgh to a university chair in Aberdeen. Stuart, too, had been promoted, having recently been moved up three rungs on the civil service ladder after incurring the gratitude of a government minister. This had happened after Stuart, in a moment of sheer frustration, had submitted the numbers from The Scotsman&#x2019;s Sudoku puzzle to the minister, representing them as likely North Sea oil production volumes. He had immediately felt guilty about this adolescent gesture&#x2014;homo ludens, playful man, might be appreciated in the arts but not in the civil service&#x2014;and had he been able to retract the figures he would have done so. But it was too late; the minister was delighted with the encouraging projection, with the result that any confession by Stuart would have been a career-terminating event. So he remained silent, and was immensely relieved to discover later that the real figures, once unearthed, were so close to his Sudoku numbers as to make no difference. His conscience was saved by coincidence, but never again, he said to himself.<br><br>Irene had no interest in statistics and always adopted a glazed expression at any mention of the subject. &#x201c;I can accept that what you do is very important, Stuart,&#x201d; she said, in a pinched, rather pained tone, &#x201c;but frankly it leaves me cold. No offence, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Her own interests were focused on psychology&#x2014;she had a keen interest in the writings of Melanie Klein&#x2014;and the raising of children. Bertie&#x2019;s education, in particular, was a matter of great concern to her, and she had already written an article for the journal Progressive Motherhood, in which she had set out the objectives of what she described as &#x201c;the Bertie Project.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The emphasis,&#x201d; she wrote, &#x201c;must always be on the flourishing of the child&#x2019;s own personality. Yet this overriding goal is not incompatible with the provision of a programme of interest-enhancement in the child herself&#x201d; (Irene was not one to use the male pronoun when a feminine form existed). &#x201c;In the case of Bertie, I constructed a broad and fulfilling programme of intellectual stimulation introducing him at a very early stage (four months) to the possibilities of theatre, music and the plastic arts. The inability of the very small infant to articulate a response to the theatre, for example, is not an indication of lack of appreciation&#x2014;far from it, in fact. Bertie was at the age of four months taken to a performance by the Contemporary Theatre of Krakow at the Edinburgh Festival and reacted very positively to the rapid changes of light on the stage. There are many other examples. His response to Klee, for instance, was noticeable when he was barely three, and by the age of four he was quite capable of distinguishing Peploe from Matisse.&#x201d;<br><br>Some of these claims had some truth to them. Bertie was, in fact, extremely talented, and had read way beyond what one might expect to find in a six-year-old. Most six-year-olds, if they can read at all, are restricted to the doings of Spot the Dog and other relatively unsubtle characters; Bertie, by contrast, had already consumed not only the complete works of Roald Dahl for children, but also half of Norman Lebrecht&#x2019;s book on Mahler and almost seventy pages of Miranda Car�ter&#x2019;s biography of the late Anthony Blunt. His choice of this reading, which was prodigious on any view, was dependent on what he happened to find lying about on his parents&#x2019; bookshelves, and this was, of course, the reason why he had also dipped into several volumes of Melanie Klein and was acquainted too with a number of Freud&#x2019;s accounts of his famous cases, especially those of Little Hans and the Wolf Man.<br><br>Little Hans struck Bertie as being an entirely reasonable boy, who had just as little need of analysis as he himself had.<br><br>&#x201c;I think Dr. Freud shouldn&#x2019;t have worried about that boy Hans,&#x201d; Bertie remarked to his mother, as they made their way one afternoon to the consulting rooms of Bertie&#x2019;s psychotherapist in Queen Street. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think there was anything wrong with him, Mummy, I really don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a matter of opinion, Bertie,&#x201d; answered Irene. &#x201c;And actually it&#x2019;s Professor Freud, not Dr. Freud.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Bertie. &#x201c;Professor Freud then. Why does he keep going on about . . .&#x201d; He lowered his voice, and then became silent.<br><br>&#x201c;About what, Bertie?&#x201d; asked Irene. &#x201c;What do you think Professor Freud goes on about?&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie slowed his pace. He was looking down at the ground with studious intensity. &#x201c;About bo . . .&#x201d; he half-whispered. Modesty prevented his completing the sentence.<br><br>&#x201c;About what, Bertie?&#x201d; prompted Irene. &#x201c;We mustn&#x2019;t mumble, carissimo. We must speak clearly so that others can understand what we have to say.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie looked anxiously about him. He decided to change the subject. &#x201c;What about my birthday, Mummy?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Irene looked down at her son. &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s coming up very soon, Bertie. Next week, in fact. Are you excited?&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie nodded. He had waited so long for this birthday&#x2014;his seventh&#x2014;that he found it difficult to believe that it was now about to arrive. It seemed to him that it had been years since the last one, and he had almost given up on the thought of turning seven, let alone eighteen, which he knew was the age at which one could leave one&#x2019;s mother. That was the real goal&#x2014;a distant, impossibly exciting, shimmering objective. Freedom.<br><br>&#x201c;Will I get any presents?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Irene smiled. &#x201c;Of course you will, Bertie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a Swiss Army penknife,&#x201d; he half-whispered. &#x201c;Or a fishing rod.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;Other boys have these things,&#x201d; Bertie pleaded.<br><br>Irene pursed her lips. &#x201c;Other boys? Do you mean Tofu?&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie nodded miserably.<br><br>&#x201c;Well the less said about him the better,&#x201d; said Irene. She sighed. Why did men&#x2014;and little boys too&#x2014;have to hanker after weapons when they already had their . . . She shook her head in exasperation. What was the point of all this effort if, after years of striving to protect Bertie from gender stereotypes, he came up with a request for a knife? It was a question of the number of chromosomes, she thought: therein lay the core of the problem.<br><br>2. Essex Girls et al<br><br>From Bertie&#x2019;s point of view his approaching birthday was the cause of immense excitement. Not only was there the issue of presents&#x2014;although he was virtually reconciled to not getting what he wanted, as his mother had on previous birthdays always been careful to choose gender-neutral gifts&#x2014;there was also the question of the party Irene had promised him. This was something to which Bertie looked forward with keen anticipation, although he knew that here, too, there would be snares and pitfalls that would require very careful evasive action on his part.<br><br>The greatest problem, of course, was the list of those to be invited. If Bertie had his way, the guests would all be boys, as that would mean that they would be able to play the games they wanted without having to take into account the wishes of any girls. Bertie had once been to a party where the guests had played British Bulldog, and he had enjoyed that every bit as much as that other game of rough and tumble, Chase the Dentist. Girls, he had learned, liked neither of these games, on the grounds that the boys, being rougher and more inclined to push and shove, had a natural advantage over them.<br><br>But the list, he knew, could not be an all-boy one, as Irene had made it very clear that she expected an equal number of boy and girl guests.<br><br>&#x201c;There are plenty of nice girls who&#x2019;d love to come to your party, Bertie,&#x201d; she assured him. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s Olive, obviously, and Olive&#x2019;s friend Pansy. Then there&#x2019;s that pleasant girl Chardonnay, although heaven knows why her parents should saddle her with such a name . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It sounds rather nice,&#x201d; said Bertie. &#x201c;I think she likes it. And she&#x2019;s got a little sister called Shiraz. That&#x2019;s a nice name too, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene rolled her eyes upwards. &#x201c;Such names are . . . well, they&#x2019;re rather closely linked with . . . well, Bertie, I&#x2019;m sorry to say they are rather closely associated with Essex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Essex?&#x201d; said Bertie. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Essex a place in England, Mummy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes it is,&#x201d; said Irene. &#x201c;Unfortunately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean, Mummy? Are there lots of girls called Chardonnay in Essex, but not in Edinburgh?&#x201d;<br><br>Irene suppressed a smile. &#x201c;You could say that, Bertie. Chardonnay is not really an Edinburgh name. But Essex, you see, is a bit . . . It&#x2019;s a bit . . . well, let&#x2019;s not worry about Essex, Bertie. Chardonnay can&#x2019;t help her unfortunate name, and I&#x2019;m sure that she&#x2019;ll love to come to your party.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;ll be boys too,&#x201d; said Bertie quickly.<br><br>Irene nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure that Ranald will be very happy to come.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Tofu.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene made a non-committal noise. &#x201c;I thought you found Tofu a bit difficult, Bertie.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie nodded. &#x201c;Yes, he is, Mummy. But I have to invite him. He&#x2019;d hear about the party and if I didn&#x2019;t invite him, there&#x2019;d be trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>The conversation about guests continued for some time, but Bertie&#x2019;s mind was not really on it. He was now remembering the party he had attended several weeks earlier, which had been to celebrate Olive&#x2019;s seventh birthday. Bertie had been reluctant to go to this but had been obliged by his mother to accept the invitation. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll enjoy yourself once you&#x2019;re there, Bertie,&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;I often find that myself when Mummy and Daddy have to go out. We may not be in the mood to begin with, but then we find that we enjoy ourselves quite a lot once we&#x2019;re there. Daddy often finds that.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie thought about this. &#x201c;Is that because he gets drunk, Mummy?&#x201d;<br><br>Irene looked shocked. &#x201c;Bertie, you mustn&#x2019;t say things like that. Daddy doesn&#x2019;t get drunk at cocktail parties. Anyway, the point is this: you&#x2019;ll enjoy Olive&#x2019;s party once you&#x2019;re there&#x2014;you mark my words.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie did not enjoy himself. When he arrived at Olive&#x2019;s house in the Braids, his heart sank as he saw the cluster of pink balloons tied to the gatepost at the end of the short drive. And it sank even further when he realised that of the twelve guests invited by Olive, he was the only boy.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Ranald coming?&#x201d; he asked Olive as he handed over her present.<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly not,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;Ranald Braveheart Macpherson has not been invited to my house and never will be, with those stupid thin legs of his! No, Bertie, you are the only boy who is privileged to join us today, and you should be jolly grateful for that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Pansy, shaking her finger at him. &#x201c;You should know just how lucky you are, Bertie.&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie did not argue. He was outnumbered in every way, and he had long ago learned that arguing with Olive got one nowhere. So he busied himself with a sausage roll and a slice of pizza and waited for events to take their natural course.<br><br>After tea, Olive had clapped her hands and announced that it was time for games. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to play a game now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A really good one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Houses?&#x201d; asked Pansy. &#x201c;Could we play houses, Olive?&#x201d;<br><br>Olive appeared to give this request full consideration before she shook her head. &#x201c;No, we shall not play houses, Pansy. Houses is a very yesterday game. We&#x2019;re going to play Jane Austen!&#x201d;<br><br>There were squeals of pleasure and excitement from several of the girls. &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; enthused Pansy. &#x201c;Jane Austen!&#x201d; And then she asked, &#x201c;How do you play that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be Lizzie,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a girl with lots of sisters. Pansy, you can be her Mummy, who is very stupid, and Lakshmi, you can be her sister Jane. And Bertie . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Bertie looked away. It was only three o&#x2019;clock and the party was due to go on until five. Two hours of Jane Austen stretched ahead of him.<br><br>&#x201c;And you, Bertie,&#x201d; said Olive decisively, &#x201c;you can be Mr. Darcy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do I do that?&#x201d; whispered Bertie. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to play Jane Austen, Olive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You just stand there and be handsome,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all you have to do. And when one of the sisters asks you to dance, then you have to bow and say, &#x2018;Madam, I would be most honoured, truly I would.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s all. You don&#x2019;t have to say anything else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long do I have to do that for?&#x201d; asked Bertie.<br><br>&#x201c;An hour or so,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;re going to play another game. Royal Weddings!&#x201d;<br><br>There were further squeals of excitement, but from Bertie there came only a sigh. Royal Weddings, he felt, was a game that adults played&#x2014;not children.</p><h2>The Book of Dharma: Making Enlightened Choices</h2><p><p><em>The Book of Dharma</em> charts Simon Haas's journey to India and his "excavation" of the Dharma Code, a powerful system for making enlightened choices and directing our life more consciously.

How does such a thing happen to a married woman of maturity and gravitas, a renowned scientist whose first encounter with her lover took place in the halls of Parliament, where she had just testified before a government committee? In this masterful novel by British journalist/novelist/playwright Louise Doughty, every page builds the case that it&#x2019;s often the smartest among us who invent the most unreliable stories about ourselves, and how it&#x2019;s possible--likely, even--for essentially good solid people to do bad and stupid things.

A maelstrom of Cold War intrigue and espionage, <b>The Year of the Tiger</b> is Higgins at his best.</p><p>Jack Higgins lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands.Paul Chavasse, head of MI5, is about to retire when he meets a Tibetan monk who asks about his rescue of Dr. Karl Hoffner from Tibet. As Chavasse recounts his adventure in 1960, Higgins covers the politics of China, Tibet, and Russia, as well as their political relations with Britain and the United States. Patrick MacNee follows the complex plots and action, switching from British English to representations of English by Russian, Tibetan, and Chinese characters. Although the representations seem true to life, they're a little stilted, and MacNee seems to have problems keeping the characterizations consistent, causing the listener to question which speaker is talking. MacNee brings the Cold War and its strange bedfellows to life with Higgins's words and myriad plots.

Unlike other graphic design books,<b> The Elements of Graphic Design</b>reveals the secrets of successful graphic design from the unique perspective of the page&#x2019;s &#x201c;white space.&#x201d; With the help of carefully selected examples from art, design, and architecture, the book illuminates the role of each design element and how it can be rendered more effective by including white space in the page architecture. The book also demonstrates how white space can lend &#x201c;sound&#x201d; to typography or shift the &#x201c;weight&#x201d; of a page. Clear, insightful comments are presented in a dynamic page design, and interactive design elements, thought-provoking captions, and scores of illustrations challenge designers to &#x201c;think out of the box.&#x201d;.</p><p>Looking At Your Work with Critical Eyes; <p>Designers Train Their Inner Judgement with Alexander White&#x2019;s New Graphic Design Primer </p><p>Since graphic design went mainstream, lots of highly creative talent has found its way into the industry. Yet when it comes to the quality of today&#x2019;s design work, the absence of solid aesthetic judgement is often painfully evident. </p><p>Boosting the critical and creative sensibilities of design students, self-made designers, and routine-trapped professionals is the goal of THE ELEMENTS OF GRAPHIC DESIGN, a new book by the highly respected graphic designer and design educator Alexander White. In this incisive text, generously illustrated by 350 examples from art, architecture, pop culture, advertising and editorial design, the author demonstrates how imaginative thinking and the lessons gleaned from the best design can lead to quantum leaps in one&#x2019;s design work. </p><p>The foundation of White&#x2019;s approach to design is the element of space and its counterpart, negative or "white space." With convincing arguments, the author shows that thinking about page design from the point of view of "solids and voids" opens the doors to new, more efficient design solutions. </p><p>"The single most overlooked element in visual design is emptiness," the author observes. "The lack of attention it receives explains the abundance of ugly and unread design . . . [Emptiness] is more than just the background of a design, for if a design&#x2019;s background alone were properly constructed, the overall design would immediately double in clarity and usefulness." </p><p>White&#x2019;s stimulating comment provides beginning designers and professionals with fresh insights into creative, quality-driven design. Readers will learn to </p><p>THE ELEMENTS OF GRAPHIC DESIGN teaches designers how to<br> - Understand the principles of great page design<br> - Train theirs mind to see form more accurately and more critically<br> - Develop a sophisticated sense of the seven design components<br> - Make type choices that are driven by legibility and readability<br> - Sensitize themselves to seeing space<br> - Use space to make their design look more active </p><p>In addition, THE ELEMENTS OF GRAPHIC DESIGN boasts striking two- and four-color illustrations, a textbook-example page layout, and a detailed chapter on design history.

From its origins in late sixteenth and early seventeenth-century German Lutheranism, Pietism spread to influence Lutheran, Reformed, and Wesleyan churches throughout Europe and North America. An emphasis on conversion through personal religious experience, on heartfelt union with Christ, and on the importance of Scripture as a guide in the spiritual life has characterized the movement whose influence is still evident today. <p>This volume is the most comprehensive collection of Pietist writings available in English. Here, skillfully edited by Professor Peter Erb, are the works of Philip Jakob Spener, August Francke and the Halle School, the Radical Pietists Gottfried Arnold and Gerhard Tersteegen, the Wurttemberg Pietists Johann Bengel and Friedrich Oetinger, and the founder of Herrnhut, Count Zinzendorf.</p></p><p></p><h2>You Can't Spank a Kid in a Snowsuit &amp; Other Lessons on Parenting</h2><p>Book about parenting</p><p></p><h2>The Samurai&#39;s Tale</h2><p>Spared after a raid by the soldiers of the powerful Lord Takeda, Taro becomes a member of the household of Lord Akiyama, in a epic tale set amid the turmoil of sixteenth-century Japan</p><p>Erik Haugaard was born in Denmark and has traveled extensively in the United States, Italy, Spain, and Japan.

From an estimated original 10,000 to 20,000 individuals, the world population has expanded to more than six billion. This book describes how it has spread over the world. </p><p> The compelling stories of the world's peoples and their migrations through time are enhanced by informative annotated maps and informative timelines. Photographs, paintings and artifacts bring to life the history of human migration. In easy-to-understand language, a team of academic experts examines mass migrations -the motivations behind them, and their impact on the world. </p><p> The book includes:</p><ul> <li>An introduction to the main causes of human migrations</li> <li>The economic and social effects of migrations, traditional routes, and expected future migrations</li> <li>The prehistoric migrations of early humans</li> <li>Indo-European expansion, the Exodus, Polynesian and Greek colonization, and the Romans</li> <li>Medieval civilizations on the move -- Barbarians, Vikings, Mongols, Arabs and the Bantu</li> <li>Expansion through colonization, and the impact of convict ships and the slave trade</li> <li>Industrialization and the emergence of modern empires</li> <li>Famine, war, persecution and economic collapse in the turbulent 1800s</li> <li>The emergence of the state of Israel, the Eastern Bloc collapse, the India and Pakistan partition, the decolonization of Vietnam and Algeria, and Africa's civil wars.</li> </ul><p> <b>The Atlas of Human Migration</b> is the definitive record of our planet's people and a volume that will be recognized immediately as an essential popular reference. </p></p><p><p> <b>Russell King</b> is head of the Geography Department at Sussex University in England. He has edited and contributed to numerous works, including <i>Mass Migration in Europe, Writing Across Worlds: Literature and Migration and Exploding the Migration Myths</i>. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> The standard dictionary definition of human migration, which usually runs along the lines of "the movement of people from one place or country to settle in another," suggests little of the depth of meaning or the scale of the phenomenon, both in the contemporary world and throughout history. The current preoccupation with controlling immigration in the so-called developed world tends to overlook the fundamental benefits that migration has brought to many places through the ages, contributing to both the economic development and the special character of many cities and even entire countries. This book tells this epic story of civilizations and their movement -- of ideas and cultures that travel, and of people leaving home in search of a different and better way of life. Like all good books that seek to inform and educate, it brilliantly illuminates the "grand narrative" -- of the constant thread of migration running through the weave of human history -- using the fascinating detail of local case studies carefully selected from around the world. </p></p><h2>The Pot Thief Who Studied Billy the Kid (The Pot Thief Mysteries)</h2><p><b>This New Mexico pottery dealer skirts the law&#x2014;and solves crimes: &#x201c;Very humorous and delightful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with a questionable hero the reader can&#x2019;t help but love&#x201d; (<i>Kings River Life Magazine</i>).</b><br> &nbsp; Although his work is technically illegal, Hubie Schuze has no qualms with digging up ancient Native American artifacts.

And, what was worse, it was totally unreadable, for the words on its pages were fuzzed beyond comprehension.<br><br>Vexed and bewildered, and more than a little concerned, Clio resolved to leave the quiet comfort of her study on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, and ask her old friend, the Good Magician Humfrey, to search a solution to her problem in his Book of Answers.<br><br>But, much to her consternation, Humfrey required her to perform a magical Service before she could acquire her Answer: to rescue Xanth's dragons from the verge of extinction before the delicate balance of its wildlife was permanently thrown out of whack.<br><br>Her momentous mission lead her to a dangerous Dragon World hidden amongst the Moons of Ida, across a perilous landscape filled with wonder and danger, in search of the fabled Currant, a very rare red berry that might hold the secret she sought. <br><br>Along the way she acquired a fellowship of companions, including the brave and beautiful Becka Dragongirl, a pair of pocket dragons named Drew and Drusie, a charming young child called Ciriana whose destiny was somehow entwined with hers, and Sherlock, a sweet but homely man from Mundania who might just be a master magician himself.<br><br>Together they gradually began to unravel the momentous mystery of Xanth's missing history.

Dust did tend to collect, along with dried bugs, apple seeds, and lost wisps of fog. Then she paused, which was easy to do during a dull chore like this. There was a volume on the shelf she didn't remember. That was odd, because she had an excellent memory. She had to, to be a competent Muse of History.<br><br>She lifted it up, noting the clean spot of shelf beneath it. She blew off the dust and looked at the title. She couldn't quite make it out, so she opened the volume to the title page. That was written in her handwriting, but was somehow blurred. It might be CURRENT EVENTS, but could also be GETTING EVEN. Neither one made much sense, as she did not handle either contemporary news or revenge plots. Her specialty was history, past and future. The present bored her.<br><br>She turned the pages. They had all been filled out, and definitely in her handwriting, but she couldn't read a word of it. She blinked to clear her vision, but it didn't help; every word was fuzzed. The pages might as well have been blank.<br><br>She stood there, bemused. How could she have written a volume of history that she herself couldn't read? It didn't make sense. Was she losing her sight?<br><br>Alarmed, she set the volume down and picked up the one next to it. That one was clear enough: PET PEEVE, with a picture of a disgruntled bird. That was incomplete, because it hadn't happened yet; she was working on it. So she checked the prior volume: CUBE ROUTE, which was complete. That was the story of a girl with gumption, and the text was quite clear.<br><br>So it wasn't her eyes, which was a relief. It was the volume. What was wrong with it? And why couldn't she remember writing it? How could she be writing the following volume, and remember its details, while being fuzzy on this one?<br><br>Fuzzy: her memory of it was as fuzzy as its print. There was definitely something strange here.<br><br>She considered for a good three and a half moments. She seemed to have two or more unenviable choices: principally to let the riddle be, or go to Good Magician Humfrey for advice. Humfrey could surely unravel the enigma, but would take obscene pleasure in her predicament. She hated giving him that satisfaction. But she knew the mystery would bug her until it became a downright nuisance.<br><br>She sighed. She would stuff her pride into her nonexistent handbag and go to see the Good Magician.<br><br>Humfrey's castle was some distance away from the home of the Muses, so Clio got transportation. She walked down Mount Parnassus and out to a babbling brook and spoke to it. "May I have your attention for a moment?"<br><br>The brook ceased babbling and formed a swirling eye. It looked at her, recognized her, and formed a mouth. "So good to see you, Muse," it bubbled.<br><br>"I need to pay a call on the Good Magician. Do you suppose I could prevail on you to transport me there swiftly?"<br><br>"Gladly, Muse. I owe you favors from way back."<br><br>That was true, but she hadn't cared to put it that way. "Then I should be obliged if you would run me there now."<br><br>The water humped up into a shape like that of a centaur without a human forepart, standing in the riverbed. "Immediately," it agreed. "If I can make it past the fish."<br><br>"The fish?"<br><br>"Recently there have been so many fish they clog my channel. It has never been this bad before; normally the water dragons eat them."<br><br>"The dragons must be off their feed," she said. That was humor; dragons were never off their feed. Still, it was an oddity.<br><br>Clio stepped close to the bank, glanced around to be sure no one was watching, then lifted one leg and swung it over the centaur's back. Skirts were not the most convenient clothing for riding, but they were required for her gender and age. She caught hold of the liquid creature's flowing mane and drew herself fully onto it. "I am ready."<br><br>The legs of the water horse went into instant motion. It galloped down the riverbed, following its twisting channel. It had to, because it was unable to run anywhere else. But the running water was so swift that it would soon reach the Good Magician's castle regardless of the indirectness of the route.<br><br>She looked down through the horse's translucent substance. Sure enough, the channel was packed with fish so thick it was almost solid. She looked across the landscape around the river channel, and saw rabbits in similar number; in places they were like a gray blanket covering the ground. That was another oddity; were the land dragons similarly off their feed?<br><br>She looked in the sky, and saw clouds of crows harassing the other flying creatures. Where were the flying dragons? Normally crows were hardly in evidence, because dragons toasted them on sight. Only in Mundania did they really flourish, normally.<br><br>Soon they were in sight of the castle. There was a stream access to the moat that enabled the water horse to reach it. In hardly more time that it took to see it, they were there, splashing to a halt.<br><br>The moat monster was snoozing, hardly expecting any intrusion from this direction. It lifted its head and gaped menacingly. Then it recognized the visitors, nodded, and returned to its snooze.<br><br>"I thank you kindly," Clio said, dismounting. The water horse had stopped beside a steep bank so that her foot could readily reach it. "Your swiftness was a real pleasure."<br><br>The horse nodded, dripping with pleasure. Then it galloped back the way it had come. Running water could never pause long, or it lost its definition.<br><br>A sad young woman was walking away from the castle, staring at the ground. "What's the matter?" Clio asked. "I'm Clio; maybe I can help."<br><br>"I'm Cayla. I came to ask the Good Magician what my talent is, because I haven't found it yet." She twiddled nervously with a wooden twig she carried.<br><br>"That's something you usually just have to find out on your own," Clio said. "It's almost impossible to guess."<br><br>"Yes, I've tried guessing," Cayla said. "It doesn't work." She twiddled some more; the twig was taking a beating. In fact there were two twigs getting intertwined.<br><br>"So did the Good Magician have the Answer for you?"<br><br>Cayla burst into tears. "No! I never got to see him. In fact I flunked the first Challenge."<br><br>Clio was morbidly curious. "What was it?"<br><br>"It was a big square park set on its end. That is, one corner was toward me as I came to it. I thought the challenge was to get in, but when I got in nothing happened. There was a ball flying around in there, but I had no idea what to do with it. I finally gave up." She blew her nose into a handkerchief, then returned to twiddling the twigs.<br><br>A square park, set on its end. "A diamond!" Clio said. "A baseball diamond. You weren't supposed to get 'in,' you needed to get an 'out.' By catching the ball."<br><br>Cayla looked at her. "I don't understand."<br><br>Clio realized that this would be complicated to explain. "It's only a guess." Then she noticed something. The two twigs were not just intertwined, they were knitted together. "Do you knit?"<br><br>"Yes, when I have wool."<br><br>"Have you tried knitting other things?"<br><br>"Of course not. Why would I do that?"<br><br>"Look at those twigs."<br><br>"Oh, these are nothing. I'm just frustrated and nervous."<br><br>"They are knitted together."<br><br>Cayla looked. "Why so they are. But I don't have knitting needles."<br><br>"Try something else," Clio said. She looked around and found several bricks. She picked two up. "Try these."<br><br>"Bricks? That's crazy!" But the girl took them and put them together.<br><br>The bricks twisted and merged. They were getting knitted together. "That's your talent," Clio said. "You can knit wood and bricks. Maybe other things. Maybe anything. You'll have to experiment and find out."<br><br>"Oh!" Cayla said, thrilled. "So I don't need the good Magician after all!"<br><br>"You don't," Clio agreed, pleased. This was her first personal interaction with a human person in regular Xanth in some time, and she was glad it had been positive.<br><br>"Thank you so much! I was so sad; now I'm so happy." Cayla ran on along the path.<br><br>Clio walked toward the drawbridge. This was the obvious way to cross the moat, as she didn't wish to get her feet or skirt wet. But as she approached it, it lifted off the bank, being drawn up by its chains.<br><br>"Halt!" she cried. "I wish to use you."<br><br>The bridge halted.<br><br>She arrived at its resting spot. "Now if you will just drop back down to the bank, I shall be happy to set foot on your sturdy surface," she said.<br><br>The bridge started to drop, but a chain snarled and it got hung up. It was stuck a small but inconvenient distance above the ground.<br><br>Clio considered it, an unbecoming suspicion hovering at the fringe of her awareness. It wasn't like the Good Magician to have flawed mechanisms. Was it possible that this was not a malfunction? That she was being subjected to a Challenge for entry?<br><br>No, of course not; she couldn't believe that of her old friend Humfrey. So it must be a rare glitch in the mechanism.<br><br>"Hello the castle!" she called. "You appear to have a problem. The drawbridge is stuck."<br><br>There was a little shed associated with the near side of the drawbridge. Now the bridge tender emerged. "Harold the Handyman here. What can I do for you?"<br><br>"I am Clio, the Muse of History. I wish to confer with the Good Magician Humfrey, but am unable to cross the moat. Can you fix the connection?"<br><br>"Sure, I'll be glad to lend a hand," Handy said, extending his right hand.<br><br>She took it. "Excellent. The lines seem to be snarled, so---EEEEEK!" Her scream was a full five E's, and would have been six, had she not run out of breath.<br><br>For the man's left hand had just reached around and goosed her right through her skirt.<br><br>"Oh, I'm so sorry," Harold said, hastily retreating. "I forget to warn you. I have two hands."<br><br>"I appreciate that," she said somewhat coldly as she rubbed her indignant bottom.<br><br>"I mean, they're different. My right hand helps others, but my wrong hand roves. I can't stop them."<br><br>She saw his problem. "Perhaps the Good Magician can help you with that problem."<br><br>"Maybe, after I complete my year of service."<br><br>"I should think he would fix the problem first, to better enable you to perform your service effectively."<br><br>"Not exactly. This is my service."<br><br>"Tending the drawbridge," she agreed.<br><br>"No. Being a Challenge."<br><br>She gazed at him. "You are a Challenge?"<br><br>"That's right. Any querent has to navigate three Challenges before getting into the castle to query the Good Magician. He doesn't like to be bothered by folk who aren't serious."<br><br>"I know that. But I'm not a querent; I'm his friend!"<br><br>"You're coming to ask his advice."<br><br>The hovering suspicion abruptly landed. She was indeed being subjected to the Challenges. That was as outrageous to her mind as was the goose to her bottom. "Well, I never!"<br><br>"My right hand should be able to fix the drawbridge," Handy said. "But my wrong hand will interfere. So I have to deal with my hands before I can deal with the problem."<br><br>"And I am expected to fathom how to resolve your problem of hands," Clio said. "As the first of my Challenges."<br><br>"You catch on quickly," the man agreed.<br><br>She was tempted to think an unkind thought about Humfrey, who was definitely not acting in a friendly manner. The very idea that she should be subjected to this process! He deserved to receive a sour piece of her mind. But unkindness was not in her nature, so she realized in half a moment that this was probably a confusion on Humfrey's part, an error. He used water from the Fountain of Youth to prevent himself from aging beyond a hundred years, and perhaps needed to set the mark a bit younger, to prevent senility. She would suggest that to him, as he surely did not want to be confusing his friends with querents.<br><br>But first she had to get in to see him. Well, then, there was no help for it but to tackle the three Challenges, preposterous as the situation was.<br><br>She looked at Harold the Handyman. So he had a right hand and a wrong hand. Her challenge was to discover a way to nullify the wrong one, so that he could let the right one function. She doubted that any permanent solution was within her power, as she was a Historian, not a Magician, but perhaps there could be a temporary expedient. One that would enable him to function during the interim of his Service to the Good Magician.<br><br>"I am neither a Magician nor a Doctor," she said. "So I am unable to offer a cure for your condition. But I may have a way to negate enough of its effect to enable you to perform satisfactorily."<br><br>"That would be great," Handy said.<br><br>"I believe you should identify your hands. The right one can be called Dexter, and the wrong one can be called Sinister. Put labels on them to that all who encounter you will know them well enough to be able to avoid mischief."<br><br>"That sounds great," he said. "Forewarned is foreordained."<br><br>"Forearmed," she said.<br><br>"Whatever." He fetched some sticky labels and a pen. But when his right hand tried to write on them, his wrong hand jerked the paper out from under the pen.<br><br>"Let me see if I can do that," Clio said, smiling. She took pen and paper and neatly printed DEXTER and SINISTER. "Now hold out your hands."<br><br>Handy's right hand cooperated, and she fastened its label to the back of it. But the wrong hand jerked away, raising a middle finger. A cloudlet of smoke formed around it, suggesting that this was not a nice gesture. It didn't want to be labeled.<br><br>She tried to catch it, but it dodged aside, avoiding her. Then she had a naughty idea. She stood straight, half turning away. "Very well, if I can't label you, I will go elsewhere."<br><br>The wrong hand couldn't resist. It dived in for another goose. But as it touched her skirt, she slapped the label against it. Now the hand was marked despite itself.<br><br>"You got it!" Handy exclaimed.<br><br>"Well, I should hope to be able to outsmart a mere hand." She was privately pleased despite the embarrassing touch. She had, as it were, gotten to the bottom of the problem.<br><br>The hand was so ashamed of being tricked that it hid behind the man's back. That allowed the right hand to reach up and unsnarl the lines, and the drawbridge dropped to its proper landing. She had navigated the first Challenge.<br><br>At the far end of the bridge was a gate with an oddly folded turnstile. In fact it was shaped like the letter W. Clio paused to examine it. If this was a Challenge, its operation was obscure. It was mounted on a post that allowed it to rotate, so that it should be possible to step into one of the indents and circle through to the other side. What was supposed to be so difficult about that? She was not a suspicious woman, but she distrusted this.<br><br>Still, there seemed to be no other way to proceed. She stepped into it, put her hand on an end, and pushed. It turned, briefly enclosing her as she passed through the gate, then releasing her the other side. No problem at all.<br><br>She turned to glance back---and saw another woman right behind her. She looked rather familiar. In fact she looked exactly like Clio herself in the mirror. Where had she come from? She had not been on the bridge.<br><br>"Get out of my way, witch," the woman snapped.<br><br>Clio stepped out of her way, affronted. "Who, if I may be so bold as to ask, are you?"<br><br>"Who do you think I am, idiot? I'm your double, Oilc."<br><br>"My double! How can that be?"<br><br>"Didn't you just pass through the Double-You? What did you thin...</p><h2>FreeDarko Presents: The Undisputed Guide to Pro Basketball History</h2><p>The people behind the blogging collective FreeDarko present the entire history of pro basketball, from the Celtics of Red Auerbach to LeBron and Kobe, with a taxonomy of every fight in NBA history and a feature called The Mustache Index.</p><p><b>Product Description</b><br> The history of basketball has always belonged to champions like the Celtics, the Lakers, and the Bulls. Yet the game's history cuts much deeper than that. The bottom line, the record books and retired jerseys, can never fully do justice to this wild, chaotic, and energetic game. In between the championships, there's the sight of Earl Monroe, spinning and cajoling his way to every corner of the court; or Allen Iverson, driving headlong into players twice his size. <br><br>The real history of the game is not its championships, which are indisputable, but the personalities of its heroes, which are, at least, <i>undisputed</i>. It's in<i> </i>the larger-than-life pathos of Wilt, the secret ties that bind Larry Bird to the flashy ABA, and Michael Jordan when he flew a little too high. From the prehistoric teachings of Dr. James Naismith to pioneering superstars such as LeBron James and Kevin Durant, you'll never see roundball the same way again. <br> <br> <p> <b>A Look Inside <i>FreeDarko Presents: The Undisputed Guide to Pro Basketball History</i></b> <br><b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> "Loud, Fat, and Gifted: <br>The Irrepressible Charles Barkley" </td> <td> <br> "The Hair Up There" <br> </td> <td> <br> "The Nuclear Option: <br>Wilt Chamberlain, The Man Who Went Too Far" </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br> <br><p>FreeDarko is a collective of like-minded writers and artists (Bethlehem Shoals, Jacob Weinstein, Dr. Lawyer IndianChief, Silverbird 5000, and Brown Recluse, Esq.,) who gather to celebrate (and take down) the National Basketball Association.
